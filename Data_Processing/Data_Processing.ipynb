      "Los objetivos iniciales marcados para la realización de esta tesis son los siguientes: -Estudio de robustez y seguridad de los actuales esquemas de marcado.\n",
      "El marcado de agua (watermarking) es una disciplina relacionada con la ocultación de información auxiliar en datos digitales de modo seguro, robusto e imperceptible.\n",
      "Las aplicaciones del marcado de agua son múltiples, abarcando, entre otras: -Protección de copyright.Fingerprinting.\n",
      "La historia de la ocultación de información se remonta a la antigua Grecia, donde se usaban métodos rudimentarios para transmitir mensajes imperceptibles cuyo secreto era de vital importancia.\n",
      "Ya en el siglo XX, la publicación del trabajo de Tanaka et al.\n",
      "Esta progresión es consecuencia de la facilidad con que se pueden realizar copias digitales y difundirlas, reutilizarlas o manipularlas.\n",
      "La criptografía puede proporcionar una solución a este problema, pero está asociada a hardware especializado para crear dispositivos a prueba de falsificaciones que evitan el acceso directo a los datos en formato digital.\n",
      "En este contexto de protección de copyright nacen las técnicas de marcado de agua.\n",
      "Una marca de agua es una pieza identificativa de información que se adhiere a los datos que protege, siendo difícil su extracción o eliminación del objeto marcado.\n",
      "Además del requisito de imperceptibilidad, que se puede presentar de distintas formas, también hay otras características que una marca de agua debe poseer; una de ellas es la robustez; es decir, la marca debe resistir manipulaciones de los datos tanto intencionadas como no intencionadas.\n",
      "Una segunda característica es la no eliminación estadística; un análisis estadístico no debería producir ninguna ventaja desde el punto de vista del atacante.\n",
      "Al igual que la criptografía, el marcado de agua emplea claves secretas para relacionar la información con sus propietarios, aunque el modo de establecer esa relación difiere de cómo se realiza en criptografía, principalmente debido a que el objeto marcado debe mantener su inteligibilidad.\n",
      "La información que se inserta en la marca puede ser variada, desde identificadores del propietario, creador, comprador o distribuidor, fechas de transacciones, números de serieIn modern society, digital data about individuals that could be considered to be highly personal, can be found relatively easily in the communication networks, especially the Internet.\n",
      "Although most people support the last decades’ advances in digital networks, the sensitivity of these data motivates an increasing concern about the public availability of personal data and the processing performed on them.\n",
      "On the other hand, signal processing researchers have traditionally focused on continuously improving the efficiency and robustness of the applied algorithms, while often leaving aside the crucial aspect of data privacy .\n",
      "There are many application scenarios where the need for privacy is clearly present, mainly those in which biological signals (fingerprints, faces, iris, DNA, ECG signals, MRI images,...) are involved, as they hold extremely sensitive information about users or patients, and their privacy is traditionally addressed through written consents that represent the trust that users must put on the party or parties that process their signals.\n",
      "Signal Processing in the Encrypted Domain (SPED) is an emergent research field that has arisen to effectively tackle the privacy problems involving signal processing.\n",
      "As an interdisciplinary area, it has faced from its birth the challenge of bringing together the views of the cryptographic and the signal processing communities in order to reach the target of efficiently applying privacy preserving techniques to common signal processing operations.\n",
      "This thesis presents novel research work performed within the field of SPED to provide new general-purpose privacy-preserving primitiv es, establish a whole new framework in nuclear privacy-sensitive signal processing applications like adaptive filtering, solving problems like the omnipresent cipher blow-up in encrypted iterative processing and explicitly analyzing the existing trade-offs among time efficiency, bandwidth and error propagation in these solutions.\n",
      "The work presented in this thesis provides a comprehensive comparison between different approaches for tackli ng encrypted processing, like homomorphic encryption, garbled circuits, interactive protocols and zero-knowledge proofs, and finishes proposing an extension to a recently pre sented fully-homomorphic cryptosystem, showing the potential of this approach in achieving fully noninteractive privacy-preserving out sourced processing-\n",

      "Doc_Text:  The exponential growth of the blockchain size has become a major contributing factor that hinders the decentralisation of blockchain and its potential implementations in data-heavy applications. In this paper, we propose segment blockchain, an approach that segmentises blockchain and enables nodes to only store a copy of one blockchain segment. We use PoW as a membership threshold to limit the number of nodes taken by an Adversary—the Adversary can only gain at most n/2 of nodes in a network of n nodes when it has 50% of the calculation power in the system (the Nakamoto blockchain security threshold). A segment blockchain system fails when an Adversary stores all copies of a segment, because the Adversary can then leave the system, causing a permanent loss of the segment. We theoretically prove that segment blockchain can sustain a $(AD/n)^m$ failure probability when the Adversary has no more than AD number of nodes and every segment is stored by m number of nodes. The storage requirement is mostly shrunken compared to the traditional design and therefore making the blockchain more suitable for data-heavy applications.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  We study the strategic considerations of miners participating in the bitcoin’s protocol. We formulate and study the stochastic game that underlies these strategic considerations. The miners collectively build a tree which consists of a long path and potentially short branches out of it, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the main path. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have proven to be a phenomenal success. The underlying techniques hold huge promise to change the future of financial transactions, and eventually the way people and companies compute, collaborate, and interact. At the same time, the current Bitcoin-like proof-of-work based blockchain systems are facing many challenges. In more detail, a huge amount of energy/electricity is needed for maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition, their security holds if the majority of the computing power is under the control of honest players. However, this assumption has been seriously challenged recently and Bitcoin-like systems will fail when this assumption is broken. This research proposes novel blockchain designs to address the challenges. We first propose a novel blockchain protocol, called 2-hop blockchain, by combining proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms. That said, even if the adversary controls more than 50% computing power, the honest players still have the chance to defend the blockchain via honest stake. Then we revise and implement the design to obtain a practical cryptocurrency system called Twinscoin. In more detail, we introduce a new strategy for difficulty adjustment in the hybrid blockchain and provide an analysis of it. We also show how to construct a light client for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and evaluate the proposal practically. We implement our new design. Our implementation uses a recent modular development framework for blockchains, called Scorex. It allows us to change only certain parts of an application leaving other codebase intact.\n",

Two confronting standpoints dominate the emergent debate around blockchain-based governance: discourses characterised by the presence of techno-determinist and market-driven values, which tend to ignore the complexity of social organisation; and critical accounts of such discourses which, whilst contributing to identifying limitations, consider the role of traditional centralised institutions as inherently necessary to enable democratic forms of governance. Therefore the question arises, can we build perspectives of blockchain-based governance that go beyond markets and states? In this article we draw on the Nobel laureate economist Elinor Ostrom’s principles for self-governance of communities to explore the transformative potential of blockchain. We approach blockchain through the identification and conceptualisation of affordances that this technology may provide to communities. For each affordance, we carry out a detailed analysis situating each in the context of Ostrom’s principles, considering both the potentials of algorithmic governance and the importance of incorporating communities’ social practices. The relationships found between these affordances and Ostrom’s principles allow us to provide a perspective focussed on blockchain-based commons governance. By carrying out this analysis, we aim to expand the debate from one dominated by a culture of competition to one that promotes a culture of cooperation.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Anomaly detection has been a well-studied area for a long time. Its applications in the financial sector have aided in identifying suspicious activities of hackers. However, with the advancements in the financial domain such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, it is more challenging to deceive financial systems. Despite these technological advancements many fraudulent cases have still emerged. Many artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed to deal with the anomaly detection problem; some results appear to be considerably assuring, but there is no explicit superior solution. This thesis leaps to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and blockchain by pursuing various anomaly detection techniques on transactional network data of a public financial blockchain named 'Bitcoin'. This thesis also presents an overview of the blockchain technology and its application in the financial sector in light of anomaly detection. Furthermore, it extracts the transactional data of bitcoin blockchain and analyses for malicious transactions using unsupervised machine learning techniques. A range of algorithms such as isolation forest, histogram based outlier detection (HBOS), cluster based local outlier factor (CBLOF), principal component analysis (PCA), K-means, deep autoencoder networks and ensemble method are evaluated and compared.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate whether evolutionary concepts can improve the performance, speed and convenience of algorithms in various active areas of machine learning research. Deep neural networks are exhibiting an explosion in the number of parameters that need to be trained, as well as the number of permutations of possible network architectures and hyper-parameters. There is little guidance on how to choose these and brute-force experimentation is prohibitively time consuming. We show that evolutionary algorithms can help tame this explosion of freedom, by developing an algorithm that robustly evolves near optimal deep neural network architectures and hyper-parameters across a wide range of image and sentiment classification problems. We further develop an algorithm that automatically determines whether a given data science problem is of classification or regression type, successfully choosing the correct problem type with more than 95% accuracy. Together these algorithms show that a great deal of the current \"art\" in the design of deep learning networks - and in the job of the data scientist - can be automated. Having discussed the general problem of optimising deep learning networks the thesis moves on to a specific application: the automated extraction of human sentiment from text and images of human faces. Our results reveal that our approach is able to outperform several public and/or commercial text sentiment analysis algorithms using an evolutionary algorithm that learned to encode and extend sentiment lexicons. A second analysis looked at using evolutionary algorithms to estimate text sentiment while simultaneously compressing text data. An extensive analysis of twelve sentiment datasets reveal that accurate compression is possible with 3.3% loss in classification accuracy even with 75% compression of text size, which is useful in environments where data volumes are a problem. Finally, the thesis presents improvements to automated sentiment analysis of human faces to identify emotion, an area where there has been a tremendous amount of progress using convolutional neural networks. We provide a comprehensive critique of past work, highlight recommendations and list some open, unanswered questions in facial expression recognition using convolutional neural networks. One serious challenge when implementing such networks for facial expression recognition is the large number of trainable parameters which results in long training times. We propose a novel method based on evolutionary algorithms, to reduce the number of trainable parameters whilst simultaneously retaining classification performance, and in some cases achieving superior performance. We are robustly able to reduce the number of parameters on average by 95% with no loss in classification accuracy. Overall our analyses show that evolutionary algorithms are a valuable addition to machine learning in the deep learning era: automating, compressing and/or improving results significantly, depending on the desired goal.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Machine learning is one of several approaches to artificial intelligence. It allows us to build machines that can learn from experience as opposed to being explicitly programmed. Current machine learning formulations are mostly designed for learning and performing a particular task from a tabula rasa using data available for that task. For machine learning to converge to artificial intelligence, in addition to other desiderata, it must be in a state of continual learning, i.e., have the ability to be in a continuous learning process, such that when a new task is presented, the system can leverage prior knowledge from prior tasks, in learning and performing this new task, and augment the prior knowledge with the newly acquired knowledge without having a significant adverse effect on the prior knowledge. Continual learning is key to advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Deep learning is a powerful general-purpose approach to machine learning that is able to solve numerous and various tasks with minimal modification. Deep learning extends machine learning, and specially neural networks, to learn multiple levels of distributed representations together with the required mapping function into a single composite function. The emergence of deep learning and neural networks as a generic approach to machine learning, coupled with their ability to learn versatile hierarchical representations, has paved the way for continual learning. The main aim of this thesis is the study and development of a structured approach to continual learning, leveraging the success of deep learning and neural networks.  This thesis studies the application of deep learning to a number of supervised learning tasks, and in particular, classification tasks in machine perception, e.g., image recognition, automatic speech recognition, and speech emotion recognition. The relation between the systems developed for these tasks is investigated to illuminate the layer-wise relevance of features in deep networks trained for these tasks via transfer learning, and these independent systems are unified into continual learning systems.  The main contribution of this thesis is the construction and formulation of a deep learning framework, denoted progressive learning, that allows a holistic and systematic approach to continual learning. Progressive learning comprises a number of procedures that address the continual learning desiderata. It is shown that, when tasks are related, progressive learning leads to faster learning that converges to better generalization performance using less amounts of data and a smaller number of dedicated parameters, for the tasks studied in this thesis, by accumulating and leveraging knowledge learned across tasks in a continuous manner. It is envisioned that progressive learning is a step towards a fully general continual learning framework.\n",

To that end, we propose Object-Oriented Deep Learning, a novel computational paradigm of deep learning that adopts interpretable “objects/symbols” as a basic representational atom instead of N-dimensional tensors (as in traditional “feature-oriented” deep learning). For visual processing, each “object/symbol” can explicitly package common properties of visual objects like its position, pose, scale, probability of being an object, pointers to parts, etc., providing a full spectrum of interpretable visual knowledge throughout all layers. It achieves a form of “symbolic disentanglement”, offering one solution to the important problem of disentangled representations and invariance. Basic computations of the network include predicting high-level objects and their properties from low-level objects and binding/aggregating relevant objects together. These computations operate at a more fundamental level than convolutions, capturing convolution as a special case while being significantly more general than it. All operations are executed in an input-driven fashion, thus sparsity and dynamic computation per sample are naturally supported, complementing recent popular ideas of dynamic networks and may enable new types of hardware accelerations. We experimentally show on CIFAR-10 that it can perform flexible visual processing, rivaling the performance of ConvNet, but without using any convolution. Furthermore, it can generalize to novel rotations of images that it was not trained for.This work was supported by the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM).\n",

In particular, the huge amount of variety encountered in real-world environments is extremely challenging for existing robotic control algorithms to handle. This necessistates the use of machine learning algorithms, which are able to learn controls given data. However, most conventional learning algorithms require hand-designed parameterized models and features, which are infeasible to design for many robotic tasks. Deep learning algorithms are general non-linear models which are able to learn features directly from data, making them an excellent choice for such robotics applications. However, care must be taken to design deep learning algorithms and supporting systems appropriate for the task at hand.

However, static typing has a cost: adding annotations, reading the added syntax, and wrestling with the type system to fix type errors. Type inference can ease the transition to more statically typed code and unlock the benefits of richer compile-time information, but is limited in languages like JavaScript as it cannot soundly handle duck-typing or runtime evaluation via eval. We propose DeepTyper, a deep learning model that understands which types naturally occur in certain contexts and relations and can provide type suggestions, which can often be verified by the type checker, even if it could not infer the type initially. DeepTyper, leverages an automatically aligned corpus of tokens and types to accurately predict thousands of variable and function type annotations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that context is key in accurately assigning these types and introduce a technique to reduce overfitting on local cues while highlighting the need for further improvements.

A fundamental challenge for sketch analysis is to deal with drastically different human drawing styles, particularly in terms of abstraction level. In this work, we propose the first stroke-level sketch abstraction model based on the insight of sketch abstraction as a process of trading off between the recognizability of a sketch and the number of strokes used to draw it. Concretely, we train a model for abstract sketch generation through reinforcement learning of a stroke removal policy that learns to predict which strokes can be safely removed without affecting recognizability. We show that our abstraction model can be used for various sketch analysis tasks including: (1) modeling stroke saliency and understanding the decision of sketch recognition models, (2) synthesizing sketches of variable abstraction for a given category, or reference object instance in a photo, and (3) training a FG-SBIR model with photos only, bypassing the expensive photo-sketch pair collection step.\n",

In the last years, researches using deep learning has been used in many speech processing tasks since they have provided very satisfactory results. As a first step, a Signal Analysis Module has been implemented in order to calculate the magnitude and phase of each audio file in the database. The signal is represented into its magnitude and its phase, where the magnitude is modified by the neural network, and then it is reconstructed with the original phase. The implementation of the Neural Networks is divided into two stages.The first stage was the implementation of a Speech Activity Detection Deep Neural Network (SAD-DNN). The magnitude previously calculated, applied to the noisy data, will train the SAD-DNN in order to classify each frame in speech or non-speech. This classification is useful for the network that does the final cleaning. The Speech Activity Detection Deep Neural Network is followed by a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE). The magnitude and the label speech or non-speech will be the input of this second Deep Neural Network in charge of denoising the speech signal. The first stage is also optimized to be adequate for the final task in this second stage. In order to do the training, Neural Networks require datasets. In this project the Timit corpus [9] has been used as dataset for the clean voice (target) and the QUT-NOISE TIMIT corpus[4] as noisy dataset (source). Finally, Signal Synthesis Module reconstructs the clean speech signal from the enhanced magnitudes and the phase.

Recent work builds adversaries for deep learning systems applied to image object recognition, which exploits the parameters of the system to find the minimal perturbation of the input image such that the network misclassifies it with high confidence. We adapt this approach to construct and deploy an adversary of deep learning systems applied to music content analysis. In our case, however, the input to the systems is magnitude spectral frames, which requires special care in order to produce valid input audio signals from network-derived perturbations. For two different train-test partitionings of two benchmark datasets, and two different deep architectures, we find that this adversary is very effective in defeating the resulting systems. We find the convolutional networks are more robust, however, compared with systems based on a majority vote over individually classified audio frames.

      "Doc_Text:  The past decade in computer vision research has witnessed the re-emergence of  artificial neural networks (ANN), and in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)  techniques, allowing to learn powerful feature representations from large collections of  data. Nowadays these techniques are better known under the umbrella term deep  learning and have achieved a breakthrough in performance in a wide range of image  analysis applications such as image classification, segmentation, and annotation.  Nevertheless, when attempting to apply deep learning paradigms to 3D shapes one has to face fundamental differences between images and geometric objects. The main  difference between images and 3D shapes is the non-Euclidean nature of the latter.  This implies that basic operations, such as linear combination or convolution, that are  taken for granted in the Euclidean case, are not even well defined on non-Euclidean  domains. This happens to be the major obstacle that so far has precluded the  successful application of deep learning methods on non-Euclidean geometric data.  The goal of this thesis is to overcome this obstacle by extending deep learning  tecniques (including, but not limiting to CNNs) to non-Euclidean domains. We present  different approaches providing such extension and test their effectiveness in the  context of shape similarity and correspondence applications. The proposed  approaches are evaluated on several challenging experiments, achieving state-of-the- art results significantly outperforming other methods. To the best of our knowledge,  this thesis presents different original contributions. First, this work pioneers the  generalization of CNNs to discrete manifolds. Second, it provides an alternative  formulation of the spectral convolution operation in terms of the windowed Fourier  transform to overcome the drawbacks of the Fourier one.

      "Doc_Text:  We study the problem of embedding high-dimensional visual data into low-dimensional vector representations. This is an important component in many computer vision applications involving nearest neighbor retrieval, as embedding techniques not only perform dimensionality reduction, but can also capture task-specific semantic similarities. In this thesis, we use deep neural networks to learn vector embeddings, and develop a gradient-based optimization framework that is capable of optimizing ranking-based retrieval performance metrics, such as the widely used Average Precision (AP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Our framework is applied in three applications. First, we study Supervised Hashing, which is concerned with learning compact binary vector embeddings for fast retrieval, and propose two novel solutions. The first solution optimizes Mutual Information as a surrogate ranking objective, while the other directly optimizes AP and NDCG, based on the discovery of their closed-form expressions for discrete Hamming distances. These optimization problems are NP-hard, therefore we derive their continuous relaxations to enable gradient-based optimization with neural networks. Our solutions establish the state-of-the-art on several image retrieval benchmarks. Next, we learn deep neural networks to extract Local Feature Descriptors from image patches. Local features are used universally in low-level computer vision tasks that involve sparse feature matching, such as image registration and 3D reconstruction, and their matching is a nearest neighbor retrieval problem. We leverage our AP optimization technique to learn both binary and real-valued descriptors for local image patches. Compared to competing approaches, our solution eliminates complex heuristics, and performs more accurately in the tasks of patch verification, patch retrieval, and image matching. Lastly, we tackle Deep Metric Learning, the general problem of learning real-valued vector embeddings using deep neural networks. We propose a learning to rank solution through optimizing a novel quantization-based approximation of AP. For downstream tasks such as retrieval and clustering, we demonstrate promising results on standard benchmarks, especially in the few-shot learning scenario, where the number of labeled examples per class is limited.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research which aims to create computational models that learn several representations of the data using deep architectures. These methods have become very popular over the last few years due to the remarkable results obtained in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection, natural language processing, etc.  The goal of this thesis is to present some contributions to the Deep Learning framework, particularly focused on computer vision problems dealing with images. These contributions can be summarized in two novel methods proposed: a new regularization technique for Restricted Boltzmann Machines called Mask Selective Regularization (MSR), and a powerful discriminative network called Local Deep Neural Network (Local-DNN). On the one hand, the MSR method is based on taking advantage of the benefits of the L2 and the L1 regularizations techniques. Both regularizations are applied dynamically on the parameters of the RBM according to the state of the model during training and the topology of the input space. On the other hand, the Local-DNN model is based on two key concepts: local features and deep architectures. Similar to the convolutional networks, the Local-DNN model learns from local regions in the input image using a deep neural network. The network aims to classify each local feature according to the label of the sample to which it belongs, and all of these local contributions are taken into account during testing using a simple voting scheme. The methods proposed throughout the thesis have been evaluated in several experiments using various image datasets. The results obtained show the great performance of these approaches, particularly on gender recognition using face images, where the Local-DNN improves other state-of-the-art results.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Cartographic generalization is a problem, which poses interesting challenges to automation. Whereas plenty of algorithms have been developed for the different sub-problems of generalization (e.g. simplification, displacement, aggregation), there are still cases, which are not generalized adequately or in a satisfactory way. The main problem is the interplay between different operators. In those cases the benchmark is the human operator, who is able to design an aesthetic and correct representation of the physical reality. Deep Learning methods have shown tremendous success for interpretation problems for which algorithmic methods have deficits. A prominent example is the classification and interpretation of images, where deep learning approaches outperform the traditional computer vision methods. In both domains – computer vision and cartography – humans are able to produce a solution; a prerequisite for this is, that there is the possibility to generate many training examples for the different cases. Thus, the idea in this paper is to employ Deep Learning for cartographic generalizations tasks, especially for the task of building generalization. An advantage of this task is the fact that many training data sets are available from given map series. The approach is a first attempt using an existing network. In the paper, the details of the implementation will be reported, together with an in depth analysis of the results. An outlook on future work will be given.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  As a result of the recent trend towards digitization, an increasing amount of information is recorded in clinics and hospitals, and this increasingly overwhelms the human decision maker. This issue is one of the main reasons why Machine Learning (ML) is gaining attention in the medical domain, since ML algorithms can make use of all the available information to predict the most likely future events that will occur to each individual patient. Physicians can include these predictions in their decision processes which can lead to improved outcomes. Eventually ML can also be the basis for a decision support system that provides personalized recommendations for each individual patient. It is also worth noticing that medical datasets are becoming both longer (i.e. we have more samples collected through time) and wider (i.e. we store more variables). There- fore we need to use ML algorithms capable of modelling complex relationships among a big number of time-evolving variables. A kind of models that can capture very complex relationships are Deep Neural Networks, which have proven to be successful in other areas of ML, like for example Language Modelling, which is a use case that has some some similarities with the medical use case. However, the medical domain has a set of characteristics that make it an almost unique scenario: multiple events can occur at the same time, there are multiple sequences (i.e. multiple patients), each sequence has an associated set of static variables, both inputs and outputs can be a combination of different data types, etc. For these reasons we need to develop approaches specifically designed for the medical use case. In this work we design and develop different kind of models based on Neural Networks that are suitable for modelling medical datasets. Besides, we tackle different medical tasks and datasets, showing which models work best in each case. The first dataset we use is one collected from patients that suffered from kidney failure. The data was collected in the Charité hospital in Berlin and it is the largest data collection of its kind in Europe. Once the kidney has failed, patients face a lifelong treatment and periodic visits to the clinic for the rest of their lives. Until the hospital finds a new kidney for the patient, he or she must attend to the clinic multiple times per week in order to receive dialysis, which is a treatment that replaces many of the functions of the kidney. After the transplant has been performed, the patient receives immunosuppressive therapy to avoid the rejection of the transplanted kidney. Patients must be periodically controlled to check the status of the kidney, adjust the treatment and take care of associated diseases, such as those that arise due to the immunosuppressive therapy. This dataset started being recorded more than 30 years ago and it is composed of more than 4000 patients that underwent a renal transplantation or are waiting for it. The database has been the basis for many studies in the past. Our first goal with the nephrology dataset is to develop a system to predict the next events that will be recorded in the electronic medical record of each patient, and thus to develop the basis for a future clinical decision support system. Specifically, we model three aspects of the patient evolution: medication prescriptions, laboratory tests ordered and laboratory test results. Besides, there are a set of endpoints that can happen after a transplantation and it would be very valuable for the physicians to be able to know beforehand when one of these is going to happen. Specifically, we also predict whether the patient will die, the transplant will be rejected, or the transplant will be lost. For each visit that a patient makes to the clinic, we anticipate which of those three events (if any) will occur both within 6 months and 12 months after the visit. The second dataset that we use in this thesis is the one collected by the MEmind Wellness Tracker, which contains information related to psychiatric patients. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in the 15-29 years age group, and its prevention is one of the top public health priorities. Traditionally, psychiatric patients have been assessed by self-reports, but these su↵er from recall bias. To improve data quantity and quality, the MEmind Wellness Tracker provides a mobile application that enables patients to send daily reports about their status. Thus, this application enables physicians to get information about patients in their natural environments. Therefore this dataset contains sequential information generated by the MEmind application, sequential information generated during medical visits and static information of each patient. Our goal with this dataset is to predict the suicidal ideation value that each patient will report next. In order to model both datasets, we have developed a set of predictive Machine Learning models based on Neural Networks capable of integrating multiple sequences of data withthe background information of each patient. We compare the performance achieved by these approaches with the ones obtained with classical ML algorithms. For the task of predicting the next events that will be observed in the nephrology dataset, we obtained the best performance with a Feedforward Neural Network containing a representation layer. On the other hand, for the tasks of endpoint prediction in nephrology patients and the task of suicidal ideation prediction, we obtained the best performance with a model that combines a Feedforward Neural Network with one or multiple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using Gated Recurrent Units. We hypothesize that this kind of models that include RNNs provide the best performance when the dataset contains long-term dependencies. To our knowledge, our work is the first one that develops these kind of deep networks that combine both static and several sources of dynamic information. These models can be useful in many other medical datasets and even in datasets within other domains. We show some examples where our approach is successfully applied to non-medical datasets that also present multiple variables evolving in time. Besides, we installed the endpoints prediction model as a standalone system in the Charit ́e hospital in Berlin. For this purpose, we developed a web based user interface that the physicians can use, and an API interface that can be used to connect our predictive system with other IT systems in the hospital. These systems can be seen as a recommender system, however they do not necessarily generate valid prescriptions. For example, for certain patient, a system can predict very high probabilities for all antibiotics in the dataset. Obviously, this patient should not take all antibiotics, but only one of them. Therefore, we need a human decision maker on top of our recommender system. In order to model this decision process, we used an architecture based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs are systems based on Neural Networks that make better generative models than regular Neural Networks. Thus we trained one GAN that works on top of a regular Neural Network and show how the quality of the prescriptions gets improved. We run this experiment with a synthetic dataset that we created for this purpose. The architectures that we developed, are specially designed for modelling medical data, but they can be also useful in other use cases. We run experiments showing how we train them for modelling the readings of a sensor network and also to train a movie recommendation engine.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  The usage of Internet applications, such as social networking and e-commerce is increasing exponentially, which leads to an increased offered content. Recommender systems help users filter out relevant content from a large pool of available content. The recommender systems play a vital role in today’s internet applications. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the popular technique used to design recommendation systems. This technique recommends new content to users based on preferences that the user and similar users have. However, there are some shortcomings to current CF techniques, which affects negatively the performance of the recommendation models. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in natural language processing, computer vision and speech recognition. However, the use of deep learning in recommendation domain is relatively new. In this work, we tackle the shortcomings of collaborative filtering by using deep neural network techniques. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they only focused on modeling content descriptions, such as content information of items and auricular features of audios. Moreover, these models ignore the important factor of collaborative filtering, that is the user-item interaction function, but some models still employ matrix factorization, by using inner product on the latent features of items and users. In this project, the inner product is replaced by a neural network architecture, which learns an user-item interaction function from data. To handle any nonlinearities in the user-item interaction function, a multi-layer perceptron is used. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate improvements made by our model compared to existing popular collaborative filtering techniques. Empirical evidence shows deep learning based recommendation models have better performance.\n",

Neural networks have proved to be an important part of machine perception and other domains of artificial intelligence over the last several years. This is due to several advances that have made neural networks more practical for real world applications. The goal of this dissertation is to present several works that track some advances in deep learning including: the move from greedy unsupervised pre-training to end-to-end supervised learning, GPU accelerated training of large neural, and the more recent successes of auto-regressive models for generating high-dimensional data. This dissertation will present four of my works. The first, develops a novel convolutional auto-encoder, and shows it can learn useful features that improve supervised image classification results when data is scarce. The second, uses distributed systems with multiple GPUs to train neural networks. The third, develops a method for using neural networks for object detection in video. The fourth speeds up generation for auto-regressive models of time-series, i.e. Wavenet.

Only recently, however, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation of quantum theory and of free quantum field theory from informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical theory, allowing a refoundation of the whole physics over logically solid grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the holographic principle. In this paper I review how free quantum field theory is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the observed regime is that of small wavevectors.\n",

Several examples are presented where classical topology is changed by smoothly altering the boundary conditions.

      "Doc_Text:  Philosophical analyses of causation take many forms but one major difficulty they all aim to address is that of the spatiotemporal continuity between causes and their effects. Bertrand Russell in 1913 brought the problem to its most transparent form and made it a case against the notion of causation in physics. The issue highlighted in Russell's argument is that of temporal contiguity between cause and effect. This tension arises from the imposition of a spectrum of discrete events occupying spacetime points upon a background of spacetime continuum. An immediate and natural solution is to superpose instead spatiotemporally continuous entities, or processes, on the spacetime continuum. This is indeed the process view of physical causation advocated by Wesley Salmon and Phil Dowe. This view takes the continuous trajectories of physical objects (worldlines) as the causal connection whereby causal influences in the form of conserved quantities are transported amongst events. Because of their reliance on spatiotemporal continuity, these theories have difficulty when confronted with the discontinuous processes in the quantum domain. This thesis is concerned with process theories. It has two parts. The first part introduces and criticizes these theories, which leads to my proposal of the History Conserved Quantity Theory with Transmission. The second part considers the extension of the idea of causal processes to quantum physics. I show how a probability distribution generated by the Schrodinger wavefunction can be regarded as a conserved quantity that makes the spacetime evolution of the wavefunction a quantum causal process. However, there are conceptual problems in the interpretation of the wavefunction, chiefly to do, as I shall argue, with the difference in the behaviours of probabilistic potentials between quantum and classical physics. I propose in the final chapter, the Feynman Path Integral formulation of quantum mechanics (with the Feynman histories) as an alternative approach to incorporating the probabilistic potentials in quantum physics. This account of how to introduce causal processes in quantum mechanics fares better, I claim, than the previous one in dealing with the situational aspect of quantum phenomena that requires the consideration of events at more than one time.\n",

We performed the whole process of creating and reading the hologram of a point in virtual space by using computer simulations. We claim that the fuzzieness in quantum mechanics, in statistical physics and thermodynamics is due to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object, but a holographic projection of it. We found that the projection of a point particle is a de Broglie-type wave. This indicates that holography could be the origin of the wave nature of a particle. We have also noted that one cannot stabilize the noise (or fuzzieness) in terms of the integration grid-points of the hologram, it means that one needs to give the grid-points a physical significance. So we further claim that the space is quantized, which supports the basic assumption of quantum gravity.

      "Doc_Text:  A new generic dynamical phenomenon of pseudochaos and its relevance to the statistical physics both modern as well as traditional one are considered and explained in some detail. The pseudochaos is defined as a statistical behavior of the dynamical system with discrete energy and/or frequency spectrum. In turn, the statistical behavior is understood as time-reversible but nonrecurrent relaxation to some steady state, at average, superimposed with irregular fluctuations. The main attention is payed to the most important and universal example of pseudochaos, the so-called quantum chaos that is dynamical chaos in bounded mesoscopic quantum systems. The quantum chaos as a mechanism for implementation of the fundamental correspondence principle is also discussed. The quantum relaxation localization, a peculiar characteristic implication of pseudochaos, is reviewed in both time-dependent and conservative systems with special emphasis on the dynamical decoherence of quantum chaotic states. Recent results on the peculiar global structure of the energy shell, the Green function spectra and the eigenfunctions, both localized and ergodic, in a generic conservative quantum system are presented. Examples of pseudochaos in classical systems are given including linear oscillator and waves, digital computer and completely integrable systems. A far-reaching similarity between the dynamics of a few-freedom quantum system at high energy levels (n >> 1) and that of many--freedom one (N >> 1) is also discussed.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  It is widely believed that quantum physics is a fundamental theory describing the Universe.  As such, one would expect to be able to see how classical physics that is observed in the macroscopic world emerges from quantum theory.  This has so far largely eluded physicists, due to the inherent linear nature of quantum physics and the non-linear behaviour of classical physics.  One of the principle differences between classical and quantum physics is the statistical, probabilistic nature of quantum theory.  It is from this property that non-classical states can arise, such as entangled states.  These states possess maximal correlations.  However, they are not the only way in which correlations are created in quantum systems.  This thesis aims to show how open quantum systems naturally contain correlations from their quantum nature.  Moreover, even seemingly simple open quantum systems can behave far more complexly than expected upon the introduction of quantum feedback.  Using this effect, the dynamics may become non-linear and as such behave non-trivially.  Furthermore, it is shown how these effects may be exploited for a variety of tasks, including a computational application in hidden quantum Markov models and a quantum metrology scheme that does not require the use of exotic quantum states.  This results in the design of systems that benefit from the use of quantum mechanics, but are not constrained by the use of experimentally difficulties such as entanglement.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  The solution and complexation chemistry of zinc ions is the basis for zinc biology. In living organisms, zinc is redox-inert and has only one valence state: Zn(II). Its coordination environment in proteins is limited by oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur donors from the side chains of a few amino acids. In an estimated 10% of all human proteins, zinc has a catalytic or structural function and remains bound during the lifetime of the protein. However, in other proteins zinc ions bind reversibly with dissociation and association rates commensurate with the requirements in regulation, transport, transfer, sensing, signalling, and storage. In contrast to the extensive knowledge about zinc proteins, the coordination chemistry of the “mobile” zinc ions in these processes, i.e. when not bound to proteins, is virtually unexplored and the mechanisms of ligand exchange are poorly understood. Knowledge of the biological inorganic chemistry of zinc ions is essential for understanding its cellular biology and for designing complexes that deliver zinc to proteins and chelating agents that remove zinc from proteins, for detecting zinc ion species by qualitative and quantitative analysis, and for proper planning and execution of experiments involving zinc ions and nanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO). In most investigations, reference is made to zinc or Zn2+ without full appreciation of how biological zinc ions are buffered and how the d-block cation Zn2+ differs from s-block cations such as Ca2+ with regard to significantly higher affinity for ligands, preference for the donor atoms of ligands, and coordination dynamics. Zinc needs to be tightly controlled. The interaction with low molecular weight ligands such as water and inorganic and organic anions is highly relevant to its biology but in contrast to its coordination in proteins has not been discussed in the biochemical literature. From the discussion in this article, it is becoming evident that zinc ion speciation is important in zinc biochemistry and for biological recognition as a variety of low molecular weight zinc complexes have already been implicated in biological processes, e.g. with ATP, glutathione, citrate, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, nicotianamine, or bacillithiol.\n",

In chapters II and III, we describe the impact of reduction, an important phenomenon in the H2 production catalytic cycle, on a hydrogenase-like model.

We have also studied the binding of a proton to similar systems and, through the calculation of chemical shifts and coupling constants, confirmed the structures of iron hydrides observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In chapter V we focus on carbon-phosphorus systems that can exist in 2 or more isomeric forms. We address first the case of a system of formula C6H4P3 which has the right valence configuration to exist either as a planar structure or as a 3-dimensional cluster (nido according to Wade’s rules). We then examine whether it is possible to control the preferred conformation by the addition of substituents on the phenyl ring. Finally, we look at the rearrangement of a planar diphosphene into a cage isomer and try to understand the mechanism and in particular the role of the protonation in the conversion from planar to 3-dimensional structure.\n",

Second, after this introduction the results obtained are presented. Investigations on high-valent mercury compounds are presented and new ways to synthesise such compounds are proposed. The methods described were applied to certain systems containing short Pt-Tl contacts. It was possible to explain the interesting bonding situation in these compounds. One of the most common actinide compounds, uranium hexafluoride was investigated and a new picture of the bonding was presented. Furthermore the rareness of uranium-cyanide compounds was discussed. In a foray into the chemistry of gold, well known for its strong relativistic effects, investigations on different gold systems were performed. Analogies between Au+ and platinum on one hand and oxygen on the other were found. New systems with multiple bonds to gold were proposed to experimentalists. One of the proposed systems was spectroscopically observed shortly afterwards. A very interesting molecule, which was theoretically predicted a few years ago is WAu12. Some of its properties were calculated and the bonding situation was discussed. In a further study on gold compounds it was possible to explain the substitution pattern in bis[phosphane-gold(I)] thiocyanate complexes. This is of some help to experimentalists as the systems could not be crystallised and the structure was therefore unknown. Finally, computations on one of the heaviest elements in the periodic table were performed.

We tested different adjustment possibilities for AT and conclude that in most parts of the surface ocean the normalization concept does not reflect relationships which represent reality. In this paper, we propose a salinity adjustment based on a constant and region-specific term for S = 0, which expresses river run off, upwelling from below the lysocline, calcification, and lateral sea surface water exchange. One application of the normalization concept is its extension to AT and also CT predictions and implementation in models. We give a brief discussion on the usage of such extensions.\n",

To aid in the development of such catalysts, physical methods are used to probe the photochemistry of small molecule activation in the context of solar-to-fuels cycles. Three systems are studied in the context of HX splitting (X=Br, Cl): polypyridyl nickel complexes, NiX3(LL) (LL = bidentate phosphine) complexes, and dirhodium phosphazane complexes. Two systems are studied in the context of dioxygen activation: cryptand-encapsulated peroxide dianion and cubane models of cobalt water oxidation catalysts. Nickel complexes are shown to facilitate photo-driven H2 evolution from solutions containing HCl. Transient absorption (TA) reveals that polypyridyl ligands act as redox mediators, circumventing the inherently short excited state lifetimes common to first row transition metal complexes. By coupling the one-electron photochemistry of the polypyridyl ligands to disproportionation of reduced nickel complexes, two-electron chemistry is achieved. Halogen photoelimination is studied in a series of NiX3(LL) complexes which eliminate halogen in both solution and the solid state. Computation shows that efficient halogen photoelimination is facilitated by a dissociative LMCT excited state. TA identifies an aryl-halide complex as an intermediate in the photoelimination reaction. Halogen photoelimination from valence isomeric dirhodium phosphazane complexes, Rh2[I,III] and Rh2[II,II], is studied using TA and photocrystallography. TA suggests a common photo-intermediate that is probed by photocrystallography to reveal structural changes associated with transition to the proposed common intermediate. Oxygen activation chemistry is studied using the first soluble form of peroxide dianion. The kinetics of peroxide dianion oxidation are studied by leveraging the dianion’s propensity to form ion pairs with ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. TA kinetic data and DFT calculations facilitate a Marcus analysis which shows that the O–O bond of the peroxide dominates the internal reorganization energy. Cubane model complexes structurally related to the CoPi water oxidation catalyst are studied using TA and computations. Photooxidation by a covalently linked photosensitizer exhibits fast electron transfer rates. Calculations show extensive delocalization of the cubane molecular orbitals and examination of the excited state manifold implicates d–d excited states as facilitators of rapid charge transfer.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  International audienceIt has been for a long time recognized that nanoparticles are of great scientific interest as they are effectively a bridge between bulk materials and atomic structures. At first, size effects occurring in single elements have been studied. More recently, progress in chemical and physical synthesis routes permitted the preparation of more complex structures. Such structures take advantages of new adjustable parameters including stoichiometry, chemical ordering, shape and segregation opening new fields with tailored materials for biology, mechanics, optics magnetism, chemistry catalysis, solar cells and microelectronics. Among them, core/shell structures are a particular class of nanoparticles made with an inorganic core and one or several inorganic shell layer(s). In earlier work, the shell was merely used as a protective coating for the core. More recently, it has been shown that it is possible to tune the physical properties in a larger range than that of each material taken separately. The goal of the present review is to discuss the basic properties of the different types of core/shell nanoparticles including a large variety of heterostructures. We restrict ourselves on all inorganic (on inorganic/inorganic) core/shell structures. In the light of recent developments, the applications of inorganic core/shell particles are found in many fields including biology, chemistry, physics and engineering. In addition to a representative overview of the properties, general concepts based on solid state physics are considered for material selection.\n",

The paper discusses the relationship between the developing ideas in cultural psychology over time and some of the shared theoretical and conceptual criticisms put forward in DDP. This takes into account some of the differences between symbolic approach, activity theory and an individualistic approach to cultural psychology. In turn, some of the bigger themes within the book are discussed such as the role of ‘normalisation’ and demarcation of age, and studying the child in context and how these relate to the different account of cultural psychology and the influence these themes have had on the author’s own work. Since this paper details a personal research journey, examples are taken from work on home-school mathematics education, child language brokering and young caring. Using these examples, the paper examines how cultural psychology is interested in the mediation between culture and the person, whilst DDP asks us to question the stories and assumptions embedded within developmental psychology.\n",

Although psychology may seem to have successfuIly come of age, it is still an open question whether or not it can be further developed according to the principles of natural science, or whether it should have some unique features. Human beings, the way they think, feel and act, cannot easily be explained by \"natural laws\" alone; \"cultural rules\" have also to be taken into consideration. But these rules are genuinely of another ontological status than natural laws because they are themselves human creations, and hence are not binding because human beings can change them. Whereas the author is convinced that in the long run what psychology really has to deal with is exactly the tension between biological laws and cultural rules he restricts his argument to the \"cultural side\" of this problem. He takes “a normative stance” and argues that if some trends in cross-cultural research and theorizing are taken seriously, then cross-cultural psychology as well as mainstream psychology, will move towards what one might call \"cultural psychology\", i.e., a psychology which explicitly contains \"culture\" as a feature unique to human beings.\n",

Specifically, we asked college students to construct simple addition or division word problems for various pairs of object sets we provided. We found that they aligned the mathematical relations between arguments of arithmetic operations with the semantic relations that were evoked by the given pairs of object sets. For example, division involves an asymmetric mathematical relation between dividend and divisor (a/b  b/ a). Students who completed our mathematical task applied this asymmetric operation to object sets that readily evoked functionally asymmetric semantic relations (e.g., a apples and b baskets), but refrained from dividing object sets that did not evoke functionally asymmetric relations (e.g., a apples and b oranges). Instead, they usually related such functionally symmetric sets with the mathematically symmetric operation of addition.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Nuclear astrophysics is that branch of astrophysics which helps understanding some of the many facets of the Universe through the knowledge of the microcosm of the atomic nucleus. In the last decades much advance has been made in nuclear astrophysics thanks to the sometimes spectacular progress in the modelling of the structure and evolution of the stars, in the quality and diversity of the astronomical observations, as well as in the experimental and theoretical understanding of the atomic nucleus and of its spontaneous or induced transformations. Developments in other sub-fields of physics and chemistry have also contributed to that advance. Many long-standing problems remain to be solved, however, and the theoretical understanding of a large variety of observational facts needs to be put on safer grounds. In addition, new questions are continuously emerging, and new facts endanger old ideas. This review shows that astrophysics has been, and still is, highly demanding to nuclear physics in both its experimental and theoretical components. On top of the fact that large varieties of nuclei have to be dealt with, these nuclei are immersed in highly unusual environments which may have a significant impact on their static properties, the diversity of their transmutation modes, and on the probabilities of these modes. In order to have a chance of solving some of the problems nuclear astrophysics is facing, the astrophysicists and nuclear physicists are obviously bound to put their competence in common, and have sometimes to benefit from the help of other fields of physics, like particle physics, plasma physics or solid-state physics.\n",

Somewhat less certain are intensities in the same energy range from cosmic rays escaping from normal galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN) and interacting with intracluster gas. At higher energies, neutrinos will definitely be produced by interactions of extragalactic cosmic rays with the microwave background. With the discovery that gamma ray bursts (GRB) are extragalactic, and therefore probably the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, it seems likely that they will be copious sources of high energy neutrinos. Other sources, such as AGN and topological defects, are more speculative.

      "Doc_Text:  Core collapse supernovae are gigantic explosions of massive stars that radiate 99% of their energy in neutrinos. This provides a unique opportunity for large scale parity or charge conjugation violation. Parity violation in a strong magnetic field could lead to an asymmetry in the neutrino radiation and recoil of the newly formed neutron star. Charge conjugation violation in the neutrino-nucleon interaction reduces the ratio of neutrons to protons in the neutrino driven wind above the neutron star. This is a problem for r-process nucleosynthesis in this wind. On earth, parity violation is an excellent probe of neutrons because the weak charge of a neutron is much larger than that of a proton. The Parity Radius Experiment (PREX) at Jefferson Laboratory aims to precisely measure the neutron radius of 208Pb with parity violating elastic electron scattering. This has many implications for astrophysics, including the structure of neutron stars, and for atomic parity nonconservation experiments.\n",

In this study, we establish a firm understanding of the uncertainties in such a calculation and provide a valuable reference for planning the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. The long-established problem of cosmic ray confinement to the Galaxy is addressed in another chapter. We introduce a new wave damping mechanism, due to the presence of background turbulence, that prevents the confinement of cosmic rays by the resonant streaming instability. We also investigate the spokes in Saturn's B ring, an electrodynamic mystery that is being illuminated by new data sent back from the Cassini spacecraft. In particular, we present assessments of the presence of charged dust near the rings, and the size of currents and electric fields in the ring system. We make inferences from the Cassini discovery of oxygen ions above the rings. In addition, the previous leading theory for spoke formation is demonstrated to be unphysical. In the final chapter, we explain the wayward motions of Prometheus and Pandora, two small moons of Saturn. Previously found to be chaotic as a result of mutual interactions, we account for their behavior by analogy with a parametric pendulum. We caution that this behavior may soon enter a new regime.\n",

Axion and Dirac neutrino mass effects on supernova cooling are also discussed. The third lecture describes the supernova explosion mechanism and the associated nucleosynthesis.

      "Doc_Text:  A survey of the theory of neutrino oscillations in dense matter and neutrino backgrounds is presented. We discuss collective neutrino systems using the gyroscopic pendulum analogy and describe the motion that results from self-induced parametric resonances. The effects of dense matter on the  flavour oscillations of neutrinos are also detailed. This theory is applied to the case of continuous supernova neutrino spectra and explanations of the spectral swapping behaviour seen in numerical studies are summarized. The results of numerical simulations of supernova oscillations in turbulent supernova backgrounds are presented and discussed. We study the motion of two example supernova neutrino spectra and examine the differences in the dynamics and flavour evolution that results from adding turbulent fluctuations to the supernova matter background. We also investigate the effect that  fluctuations in the neutrino density can have on the oscillation behaviour. We find that in general the final neutrino spectra emerging from the inner supernova regions are quite robust to  fluctuations in the backgrounds in our model, while the intermediate dynamics can be very strongly altered. Some significant changes in the final spectra are also found to occur when the neutrino background density fluctuations are large. We give a detailed review of the resonant matter effects that determine the survival probabilities of atmospheric muon neutrinos. The differences between various Earth density models are described, and these models are then used to predict the flux of muon-type neutrino events in the Deep Core extension to the IceCube detector. We use recent results from the detector collaboration and build on previous work which considered the sensitivity of the detector to the mass hierarchy, and show that uncertainties in the Earth's density can have a significant influence on the event rates.\n",

Nucleosynthesis in stars and stellar explosions proceeds via nuclear reactions in thermalized plasmas. Nuclear reactions not only transmutate elements and their isotopes, and thus create all known elements from primordial hydrogen and helium, they also release energy to keep stars in hydrostatic equilibrium over astronomical timescales. A stellar plasma has to be hot enough to provide sufficient kinetic energy to the plasma components to overcome Coulomb barriers and to allow interactions between them. Plasma components in thermal equilibrium are bare atomic nuclei, free electrons, and photons (radiation). Typical temperatures of plasmas experiencing nuclear burning range from 107 K for hydrostatic hydrogen burning (mainly interactions among protons and He isotopes) to 1010 K or more in explosive events, such as supernovae or neutron star mergers. This still translates into low interaction energies by nuclear physics standards, as the most probable energy E between reaction partners in terms of temperature is derived from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and yields E = T9/11.6045 MeV, where T9 is the plasma temperature in GK.\n",

Chapters 2, 3 and 4 explore prospects for detecting gravitational waves from stellar-mass compact objects spiraling into intermediate-mass black holes with ground-based observatories. It is shown in chapter 2 that if the central body is not a BH but its metric is stationary, axisymmetric, reflection symmetric and asymptotically flat, then the waves will likely be triperiodic, as for a BH. Chapters 3 and 4 show that the evolutions of the waves' three fundamental frequencies and of the complex amplitudes of their spectral components encode (in principle) details of the central body's metric, the energy and angular momentum exchange between the central body and the orbit, and the time-evolving orbital elements. Chapter 5 studies a local readout method to enhance the low frequency sensitivity of detuned signal-recycling interferometers. We provide both the results of improvement in quantum noise and the implementation details in Advanced LIGO. Chapter 6 applies and generalizes causal Wiener filter to data analysis in macroscopic quantum mechanical experiments. With the causal Wiener filter method, we demonstrate that in theory we can put the test masses in the interferometer to its quantum mechanical ground states. Chapter 7 presents some analytical solutions for expanding fireballs, the common theoretical model for gamma ray bursts and soft gamma ray repeaters. We apply our results to SGR 1806-20 and rediscover the mismatch between the model and the afterglow observations. Chapter 8 discusses the reconstruction of the scalar-field potential of the dark energy. We advocate direct reconstruction of the scalar field potential as a way to minimize prior assumptions on the shape, and thus minimize the introduction of bias in the derived potential.

      "Doc_Text:  This thesis is about the possible consequences of the existence of scalar particles on astrophysical objects, particularly neutron stars. The existence of such particles is hypothesized by certain developments in elementary particle theory. These particles are assumed to be lights having masses less than, or of approximately one electron volt. The stipulation that these particles are light is in no way discriminatory; it just so happens that over astrophysical distances lighter particles have far greater influence because of their greater range, i.e. their Compton wavelength, and so are more interesting in this context. The introduction of this work will, after giving a brief historical summary of each subject, show how scalar fields arise in various theoretical contexts within the disciplines of particle physics and cosmology. It will also show how highly interlinked these disciplines are, and how developments in each drive and influence the other. Also included in the introduction will be a review of neutron stars and their properties and a summary of the methods of nuclear theory. The first chapter consists of the construction of an explicit model of static neutron star and scalar field configurations. The properties of these configurations are discussed at length and then used to give bounds on the coupling of this hypothetical scalar field to ordinary matter. Certain technical difficulties arising from the presence of the scalar field are also discussed. The second chapter consists of a study of the radial oscillations of the static configurations which were found in the preceding chapter. The equations of motion for the oscillations of the neutron star and scalar field are derived, after which the stability of the configurations is discussed with particular reference to the possibility of monopole scalar radiation. Lastly, an approximate calculation is made of the relaxation time of radial oscillations for a star which is radiating scalar waves. The last chapter contains a simple model of gravitational collapse with a scalar field, constructed in the manner of the Oppenheimer-Snyder model. After integration of the Einstein equations for the interior, the problem of matching to an appropriate exterior is considered. It is found that, contrary to naive expectation, matching is greatly complicated by the presence of a scalar field; both technical and conceptual problems are found to arise. Finally, the necessary conditions and procedures for construction of more general exterior solutions, which this problem seems to require, are given and discussed.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Dimensional reduction of theories involving (super-)gravity gives rise to sigma models on coset spaces of the form G/H, with G a non-compact group, and H its maximal compact subgroup. The reverse process, called oxidation, is the reconstruction of the possible higher dimensional theories, given the lower dimensional theory. In 3 dimensions, all degrees of freedom can be dualized to scalars. Given the group G for a 3 dimensional sigma model on the coset G/H, we demonstrate an efficient method for recovering the higher dimensional theories, essentially by decomposition into subgroups.

      "Doc_Text:  In the late 1920’s and early 1930’s, physicists applied group representation theory to the quantum mechanics of atomic spectra. At the same time, physicists developed an alternative approach to theoretical atomic spectra that avoids using group theory. These two approaches exhibit nontrivial intellectual differences: the group theoretic approach provides a deeper understanding of many phenomena in atomic spectra. By focusing on derivations of selection rules for atomic spectra, I explicate one case where group theory enhances understanding. I refer to the non-group theoretic approach as the commutator approach; it serves as a benchmark for comparison. This case study motivates a deflationary account of mathematical explanations in science. According to my account, both group theoretic and commutator derivations explain selection rules for atomic spectra. I use these derivations to problematize stronger accounts of mathematical explanation that rely on a notion of relevance. Arguing that selection rules are an example of universality, I also criticize a strong interpretation of Batterman and Rice’s minimal model account of explanations of universality.  After examining these accounts of explanation, I argue that explanatory criteria do not distinguish the intellectual content of the group theoretic and commutator approaches. Instead, I develop an account of scientific understanding that distinguishes these approaches based on organizational differences. Adopting terminology from Manders, I argue that these organizational differences arise from differences in the approach’s expressive means. Group theory reorganizes selection rule derivations by re-expressing physical concepts more effectively than the commutator approach. I argue that this superior organizational structure accounts for how group theory provides a heightened understanding of selection rules.\n",

We then propose a new mechanism for discrete scale invariance, based on the interplay between dynamics and disorder.

The present thesis has two broad aims. The first is to introduce a \"norm function\" in PGT as a way to capture the notion of an order of a (finite) group in PGT, extend some elementary results on  nite groups to PGT, propose a definition of a (finite) cyclic group in PGT, and make an attempt to recapture the Second Sylow Theorem. We also describe a process of building a model for normed PGT (i.e. PGT with a norm function), from a monoid equipped with a family of congruences, subject to suitable axioms. In the case of the multiplicative monoid of natural numbers equipped with the family of modular congruences, we recover the model of normed PGT formed by  nite cyclic groups. The second aim of the thesis is to introduce and study biproducts and commutators in PGT, which generalize usual products and commutators for group-like structures. Our biproducts are not categorical products, although, as we show, they form a monoidal structure. However, our notion of a biproduct is self-dual, just like (and is in fact very similar to) the one in the context of an abelian category.\n",

It is a standard result that L(S) is a closed convex cone--indeed a special such called a Lie wedge. In specific examples it is generally not so difficult to determine L(S) given S. However, in the reverse direction, it is often quite difficult to compute precisely the semigroup generated by exp(L(S)) (the so-called infinitesimally generated subsemigroup) and determine whether it is all of S.

This factorization is a characterization of embeddable matrices in a restricted sense. Also, this factorization contributes as a nice example to the Lie semigroup theory. In this way, appropriate conditions are obtained under which $\\{$exp(tX)exp(sY): t,s $\\geq$ 0$\\}$ is a Lie subsemigroup.

These equations describe the microdynamical state of turbulence, and are transformed into a master equation. By scaling, a kinetic hierarchy is generated in the form of groups, representing the spectral evolution, the diffusivity and the relaxation. The loss of memory in formulating the relaxation yields the closure. The network of sub-distributions that participates in the relaxation is simulated by a self-consistent porous medium, so that the average effect on the diffusivity is to make it approach equilibrium. The kinetic equation of turbulence is derived. The method of moments reverts it to the continuum. The equation of spectral evolution is obtained and the transport properties are calculated. In inertia turbulence, the Kolmogoroff law for weak coupling and the spectrum for the strong coupling are found. As the fluid analog, the nonlinear Schrodinger equation has a driving force in the form of emission of solitons by velocity fluctuations, and is used to describe the microdynamical state of turbulence. In order for the emission together with the modulation to participate in the transport processes, the non-homogeneous Schrodinger equation is transformed into a homogeneous master equation. By group-scaling, the master equation is decomposed into a system of transport equations, replacing the Bogoliubov system of equations of many-particle distributions.

Its positivity results in the monotonic decrease of the informational entropy under renormalization. This, however, does not necessarily imply the irreversibility of the RG flow, because the entropy explicitly depends on the total number of degrees of freedom, which is reduced. Only some size-independent additive part of the entropy could possibly provide the required Lyapunov function. We also introduce a mutual information of fast and slow variables as probably a more adequate quantity to represent the changes in the system under renormalization and evaluate it for some simple systems. It is shown that for certain real space decimation transformations the positivity of the mutual information directly leads to the monotonic growth of the entropy per lattice site along the RG flow and hence to its irreversibility\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Biodiversity and its responses to environmental changes are central issues in ecology and for society. Almost all microbial biodiversity research focuses on “species” richness and abundance but not on their interactions. Although a network approach is powerful in describing ecological interactions among species, defining the network structure in a microbial community is a great challenge. Also, although the stimulating effects of elevated CO2 (eCO2) on plant growth and primary productivity are well established, its influences on belowground microbial communities, especially microbial interactions, are poorly understood. Here, a random matrix theory (RMT)-based conceptual framework for identifying functional molecular ecological networks was developed with the high-throughput functional gene array hybridization data of soil microbial communities in a long-term grassland FACE (free air, CO2 enrichment) experiment. Our results indicate that RMT is powerful in identifying functional molecular ecological networks in microbial communities. Both functional molecular ecological networks under eCO2 and ambient CO2 (aCO2) possessed the general characteristics of complex systems such as scale free, small world, modular, and hierarchical. However, the topological structures of the functional molecular ecological networks are distinctly different between eCO2 and aCO2, at the levels of the entire communities, individual functional gene categories/groups, and functional genes/sequences, suggesting that eCO2 dramatically altered the network interactions among different microbial functional genes/populations. Such a shift in network structure is also significantly correlated with soil geochemical variables. In short, elucidating network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes is fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology, systems microbiology, and global change.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  In the area of high performance composites, epoxies are the most widely used polymer matrix due to their favorable properties including: high modulus, high glass transition temperature, and easy processability which includes low shrinkage, no volatiles, and high adhesion to fillers and fiber reinforcement. The excellent mechanical properties arise from the highly cross-linked structure of the cured epoxy resins; however, their cross-linked structure leaves them with poor resistance to crack propagation. Typically, the toughness of epoxies has been improved through the use of additives, often a phase-separating rubber. Additives can cause problems during composite processing, such as non-uniform dispersion of the toughening agent, so it is advantageous to increase the toughness of the neat resin as much as possible. Most methods for innate toughening of epoxies have relied on deviating from stoichiometry, which causes other properties to suffer. In this research systematic changes in molecular structure are investigated to determine how they affect the network properties, especially fracture properties, of neat epoxies. Bimodal amine distributions were made using polyetheramines of various molecular weights.  When cured with a rigid epoxy, the resulting networks, compared to single-distributions networks, had similar bulk cross-link densities but broader glass transitions and lower modulus due to local network heterogeneity. The fracture behaviors were altered but the toughness did not improve. Polydisperse epoxy distributions, with dispersity indices ranging from 1.8 to 10.7, when cured with a linear amine, had no noticeable impact on the network properties. Linear epoxies and blends of linear epoxies cured with rigid amines yield similar behaviors as those seen with linear amines. All structural variations can be collapsed onto unified curves by relating either the flexible volume fraction or the cross-link density to the maximum in tan δ. Local heterogeneity in the cross-link density can be taken advantage of when coupled with a secondary toughening phase. Glass beads functionalized with epoxy groups and reacted with a high molecular weight polyetheramine increased the fracture toughness more than glass beads in homogeneous network or a heterogeneous network with the shorter chains at the bead-matrix interface.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Fluctuations in the copy number of key regulatory macromolecules (“noise”) may cause physiological heterogeneity in populations of (isogenic) cells. The kinetics of processes and their wiring in molecular networks can modulate this molecular noise. Here we present a theoretical framework to study the principles of noise management by the molecular networks in living cells. The theory makes use of the natural, hierarchical organization of those networks and makes their noise management more understandable in terms of network structure. Principles governing noise management by ultrasensitive systems, signaling cascades, gene networks and feedback circuitry are discovered using this approach. For a few frequently occurring network motifs we show how they manage noise. We derive simple and intuitive equations for noise in molecule copy numbers as a determinant of physiological heterogeneity. We show how noise levels and signal sensitivity can be set independently in molecular networks, but often changes in signal sensitivity affect noise propagation. Using theory and simulations, we show that negative feedback can both enhance and reduce noise. We identify a trade-off; noise reduction in one molecular intermediate by negative feedback is at the expense of increased noise in the levels of other molecules along the feedback loop. The reactants of the processes that are strongly (cooperatively) regulated, so as to allow for negative feedback with a high strength, will display enhanced noise.\n",

Investigations have been carried out to synthesise and characterise novel 2D functional molecular networks with controllable morphologies and properties on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces. Two molecular systems that undergo non-covalent 2D self-assembly and one molecular system that demonstrates the formation of 2D covalent-organic frameworks (2D-COFs) have been studied. Following an introduction in chapter 1, chapter 2 provides a background to the doctoral research. Chapter 3 presents the experimental and theoretical methodology used during the thesis. Chapter 4 details scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) investigations of the interfacial self-assembly of a tetra-carboxylic acid derivative, 5, 5'-(anthracene-2,6-diyl) diisophthalic acid (ATC). This prochiral molecule forms chiral domains when it self-assembles into 2D molecular network at a liquid-solid interface. The morphology of the ATC networks is tuneable by changing the concentration of ATC in solution. Three distinct structural arrangements of ATC have been observed within the same 2D self-assembled network. Chapter 5 describes STM investigations of self-assembled porphyrin networks organised by selective hydrogen bonding between DNA nucleobases at a liquid-solid interface. Driven by homo-molecular thymine-thymine and hetero-molecular thymine-adenine interactions, both mono-component and bi-component self-assembled structures have been formed using freebase and metal containing thymine functionalised porphyrins. Finally, in chapter 6, a Schiff-base condensation reaction has been utilised to grow highly ordered 2D-COFs using tetra-amine functionalised porphyrin and benzene-1,4-dicarboxaldehyde (BDA) at a vapour-solid interface. These structures have been investigated experimentally using STM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The chemical composition of the 2D-COFs was found to be closely related to the environmental conditions during growth. Our results demonstrate that complementary experimental techniques that probe both the structure and the chemical composition of 2D materials are necessary when investigating 2D-COF materials.\n",

In humans, low-load endurance-type exercise leads to qualitative changes of muscle tissue characterized by an increase in structures supporting oxygen delivery and consumption, such as capillaries and mitochondria. High-load strength-type exercise leads to growth of muscle fibers dominated by an increase in contractile proteins. In endurance exercise, stress-induced signaling leads to transcriptional upregulation of genes, with Ca(2+) signaling and the energy status of the muscle cells sensed through AMPK being major input determinants. Several interrelated signaling pathways converge on the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α, perceived to be the coordinator of much of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Strength training is dominated by a translational upregulation controlled by mTORC1. mTORC1 is mainly regulated by an insulin- and/or growth-factor-dependent signaling cascade as well as mechanical and nutritional cues. Muscle growth is further supported by DNA recruitment through activation and incorporation of satellite cells. In addition, there are several negative regulators of muscle mass. We currently have a good descriptive understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the muscle phenotype. The topology of signaling networks seems highly conserved among species, with the signaling outcome being dependent on the particular way individual species make use of the options offered by the multi-nodal networks. As a consequence, muscle structural and functional modifications can be achieved by an almost unlimited combination of inputs and downstream signaling events.\n",

The pathway sets include 88 “Metabolic”, 15 “Genetic Information Processing”, 12 “Environmental Information Processing”, 3 “Cellular Processes”, 21 “Transport”, and 80 “Transcription Factors”. The quantitative data is loaded onto molecular networks, allowing the simultaneous visualization of changes in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome for a given experiment. VitisNet uses manually annotated networks in SBML or XML format, enabling the integration of large datasets, streamlining biological functional processing, and improving the understanding of dynamic processes in systems biology experiments. VitisNet is grounded in the Vitis vinifera genome (currently at 8x coverage) and can be readily updated with subsequent updates of the genome or biochemical discoveries.

      "Doc_Text:  Current efforts to study the genetic underpinnings of higher brain functions have been lacking appropriate phenotypes to describe cognition. One of the problems is that many cognitive concepts for which there is a single word (e.g. attention) have been shown to be related to several anatomical networks. Recently, we have developed an Attention Network Test (ANT) that provides a separate measure for each of three anatomically defined attention networks. In this study we have measured the efficiency of neural networks related to aspects of attention using the ANT in a population of 200 adult subjects. We then examined genetic polymorphisms in four candidate genes (DRD4, DAT, COMT and MAOA) that have been shown to contribute to the risk of developing various psychiatric disorders where attention is disrupted. We find modest associations of several polymorphisms with the efficiency of executive attention but not with overall performance measures such as reaction time. These results suggest that genetic variation may underlie inter-subject variation in the efficiency of executive attention.

      "Doc_Text:  During mammary development, cellular differentiation and lineage commitment to various epithelial and mesenchymal cell types are driven by hormonal and paracrine signaling mechanisms. Understanding mechanisms that govern differentiation into distinct cell populations is critically important for a complete understanding of development and breast tumorigenesis. Previous studies have shown that retroviral transduction of fibroblasts with four transcription factors can initiate the conversion of a somatic cell into an embryonic stem cell-like state with capabilities of differentiating into cell types of all three germ layers. The goal of my thesis work was to determine whether mammary specific transcription factors (TFs) could directly induce transdifferentiation to an ER+/luminal cell phenotype starting with mouse embryonic fibroblasts via an iPS-type approach. After screening 9 candidate TFs for their abilities to induce various epithelial-specific and breast-specific attributes, we focused subsequent efforts on ESR1, FOXA1, PGR, and GATA3. In human mammary epithelial cells, ectopic overexpression of these TFs had both unique and overlapping contributions toward inducing the expression of genes responsible for luminal differentiation. Combining these TFs in fibroblasts created combinations that produced a luminal progenitor phenotype as defined by gene expression histological markers for epithelial/breast development and functionality. Examination of the gene expression patterns induced by these combinations using a classifier of differentiation status identified several genes that drive a transition toward the luminal subtype. Since there are presently no cell lines or mouse models of luminal A/ER+ breast cancers, the creation of such of a line would be of tremendous value.\n",

The periderm consists of the cork cambium producing inwards the phelloderm and outwards the phellem or cork. Phellem cells are highly suberized and develop into dead cells. Despite its biological and economic importance, the molecular mechanisms of periderm development are largely unknown. To shed light on the periderm development of Arabidopsis, marker lines for phellem and cork cambium cells were developed. Six stages of periderm growth in the root and hypocotyl were defined in this study. At stage 0 the pericycle is surrounded by the endodermis, cortex and epidermis cell layers while at stage 6 the differentiated periderm is the outside tissue of root and hypocotyl. In addition to the periderm development, these stages reveal the fate of the outside layers (endodermis, cortex and epidermis). The loosening of the outside layers follows a specific pattern that involves programmed cell death and cell abscission. Furthermore, this study shows that perturbing the cell number and identity and cell wall composition of these outside layers has an effect on the periderm development, demonstrating that a mechanical interaction occurs between the periderm cells and the outer layers. In contrast, there seems to be some kind of competition between the lateral root formation and the periderm development. In this regard, it was demonstrated that auxin plays an important role in the periderm development and many auxin-dependent early LR regulators are expressed in the periderm and are involved in its development.\n",

Time delays are common and substantial in these biochemical processes due to gene transcription, translation, posttranslation protein modification and diffusion. Molecular noises in gene networks come from intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and the global noise affecting all genes. Knowledge of molecular noise filtering and biochemical process delay compensation in gene networks is crucial to understand the signal processing in gene networks and the design of noise-tolerant and delay-robust gene circuits for synthetic biology. A nonlinear stochastic dynamic model with multiple time delays is proposed for describing a gene network under process delays, intrinsic molecular fluctuations, and extrinsic molecular noises. Then, the stochastic biochemical processing scheme of gene regulatory networks for attenuating these molecular noises and compensating process delays is investigated from the nonlinear signal processing perspective. In order to improve the robust stability for delay toleration and noise filtering, a robust gene circuit for nonlinear stochastic time-delay gene networks is engineered based on the nonlinear robust H∞ stochastic filtering scheme. Further, in order to avoid solving these complicated noise-tolerant and delay-robust design problems, based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy time-delay model and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique, a systematic gene circuit design method is proposed to simplify the design procedure. The proposed gene circuit design method has much potential for application to systems biology, synthetic biology and drug design when a gene regulatory network has to be designed for improving its robust stability and filtering ability of disease-perturbed gene network or when a synthetic gene network needs to perform robustly under process delays and molecular noises.\n",

Strategies for incorporating logic in aqueous chemistry have focused primarily on implementing components, such as logic gates, that are composed into larger circuits, with each logic gate in the circuit corresponding to one or more molecular species. With this paradigm, designing and producing new molecular species is necessary to perform larger computations. An alternative approach begins by noticing that chemical systems on the small scale are fundamentally discrete and stochastic. In particular, the exact molecular counts of each molecular species present, is an intrinsically available form of information. This might appear to be a very weak form of information, perhaps quite difficult for computations to utilize. Indeed, it has been shown that error-free Turing universal computation is impossible in this setting. Nevertheless, we show a design of a chemical computer that achieves fast and reliable Turing-universal computation using molecular counts. Our scheme uses only a small number of different molecular species to do computation of arbitrary complexity. The total probability of error of the computation can be made arbitrarily small (but not zero) by adjusting the initial molecular counts of certain species.

Identification of sub-networks in these large networks that show maximum collective response to a perturbation is one the interesting problems to solve by using an integrative analysis. Sub-networks can be hypothesized to represent significant collective biological activity due to the underlying interactions between the bio-molecules.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on popular synthetic data sets as well as publicly available experimental molecular data corresponding to gene and protein expression profiles. The improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated across the synthetic data sets using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as performance metrics. The results are also demonstrated across varying sample sizes and three different structure learning algorithms with widely varying assumptions. In all cases, the proposed approach has specificity and accuracy close to 1, while sensitivity increases linearly in the logarithm of the sample size. The estimated threshold systematically outperforms common ad hoc ones in terms of sensitivity while maintaining comparable levels of specificity and accuracy. Networks from experimental data sets are reconstructed accurately with respect to the results from the original papers. Current studies use structure learning algorithms in conjunction with ad hoc thresholds for identifying significant associations in graphical abstractions of biological pathways and signalling mechanisms.

To elucidate the effects of such discreteness, we study autocatalytic reaction systems comprising several chemical species through stochastic particle simulations. The generation of novel states is observed; it is caused by the extinction of some molecular species due to the discreteness in their number. We demonstrate that the reaction dynamics are switched by a single molecule, which leads to the reconstruction of the acting network structure. We also show the strong dependence of the chemical concentrations on the system size, which is caused by transitions to discreteness-induced novel states.\n",

In keeping with this we examine Cell Signaling Networks (CSN) which are chemical networks responsible for coordinating cell activities within their environment. Through evolution they have become highly efficient for governing critical control processes such as immunological responses, cell cycle control or homeostasis. Realising (and evolving) Artificial Cell Signaling Networks (ACSNs) may provide new computational paradigms for a variety of application areas. Our abstraction of Cell Signaling Networks focuses on four characteristic properties distinguished as follows: Computation, Evolution, Crosstalk and Robustness. These properties are also desirable for potential applications in the control systems, computation and signal processing field. These characteristics are used as a guide for the development of an ACSN evolutionary simulation platform. In this paper we present a novel evolutionary approach named Molecular Classifier System (MCS) to simulate such ACSNs.

CRNs are widely used to describe information processing occurring in natural cellular regulatory networks, and with upcoming advances in synthetic biology, CRNs are a promising programming language for the design of artificial molecular control circuitry. Due to a formal equivalence between CRNs and a model of distributed computing known as population protocols, results transfer readily between the two models. We show that if a CRN respects finite density (at most O(n) additional molecules can be produced from n initial molecules), then starting from any dense initial configuration (all molecular species initially present have initial count Ω(n), where n is the initial molecular count and volume), every producible species is produced in constant time with high probability. This implies that no CRN obeying the stated constraints can function as a timer, able to produce a molecule, but doing so only after a time that is an unbounded function of the input size.

      "Doc_Text:  This thesis has four parts, which correspond to the presentation and development of a theoretical framework for the study of cognitive capacities qua physical phenomena, and a case study of locality conditions over natural languages. Part I deals with computational considerations, setting the tone of the rest of the thesis, and introducing and defining critical concepts like ‘grammar’, ‘automaton’, and the relations between them. Fundamental questions concerning the place of formal language theory in linguistic inquiry, as well as the expressibility of linguistic and computational concepts in common terms, are raised in this part. Part II further explores the issues addressed in Part I with particular emphasis on how grammars are implemented by means of automata, and the properties of the formal languages that these automata generate. We will argue against the equation between effective computation and function-based computation, and introduce examples of computable procedures which are nevertheless impossible to capture using traditional function-based theories. The connection with cognition will be made in the light of dynamical frustrations: the irreconciliable tension between mutually incompatible tendencies that hold for a given dynamical system. We will provide arguments in favour of analyzing natural language as emerging from a tension between different systems (essentially, semantics and morpho-phonology) which impose orthogonal requirements over admissible outputs. The concept of level of organization or scale comes to the foreground here; and apparent contradictions and incommensurabilities between concepts and theories are revisited in a new light: that of dynamical nonlinear systems which are fundamentally frustrated. We will also characterize the computational system that emerges from such an architecture: the goal is to get a syntactic component which assigns the simplest possible structural description to sub-strings, in terms of its computational complexity. A system which can oscillate back and forth in the hierarchy of formal languages in assigning structural representations to local domains will be referred to as a computationally mixed system. Part III is where the really fun stuff starts. Field theory is introduced, and its applicability to neurocognitive phenomena is made explicit, with all due scale considerations. Physical and mathematical concepts are permanently interacting as we analyze phrase structure in terms of pseudo-fractals (in Mandelbrot’s sense) and define syntax as a (possibly unary) set of topological operations over completely Hausdorff (CH) ultrametric spaces. These operations, which makes field perturbations interfere, transform that initial completely Hausdorff ultrametric space into a metric, Hausdorff space with a weaker separation axiom. Syntax, in this proposal, is not ‘generative’ in any traditional sense except the ‘fully explicit theory’ rather, it partitions (technically, ‘parametrizes’) a topological space. Syntactic dependencies are defined as interferences between perturbations over a field, which reduce the total entropy of the system per cycles, at the cost of introducing further dimensions where attractors corresponding to interpretations for a phrase marker can be found. Part IV is a sample of what we can gain by further pursuing the physics of language approach, both in terms of empirical adequacy and theoretical elegance, not to mention the unlimited possibilities of interdisciplinary collaboration. In this section we set our focus on island phenomena as defined by Ross (1967), critically revisiting the most relevant literature on this topic, and establishing a typology of constructions that are strong islands, which cannot be violated. These constructions are particularly interesting because they limit the phase space of what is expressible via natural language, and thus reveal crucial aspects of its underlying dynamics. \n",

      "Doc_Text:  Indiana University, Computer Sciences, 2008Most programming languages do not allow programs to inspect their static type information or perform computations on it.  C++, however, lets programmers write template metaprograms, which enable programs to encode static information, perform compile-time computations, and make static decisions about run-time behavior. Many C++ libraries and applications use template metaprogramming to build specialized abstraction mechanisms, implement domain-specific safety checks, and improve run-time performance. Template metaprogramming is an emergent capability of the C++ type system, and the C++ language specification is informal and imprecise. As a result, template metaprogramming often involves heroic programming feats and often leads to code that is difficult to read and maintain.  Furthermore, many template-based code generation and optimization techniques rely on particular compiler implementations, rather than language semantics, for performance gains. Motivated by the capabilities and techniques of C++ template metaprogramming, this thesis documents some common programming patterns, including static computation, type analysis, generative programming, and the encoding of domain-specific static checks. It also documents notable shortcomings to current practice, including limited support for reflection, semantic ambiguity, and other issues that arise from the pioneering nature of template metaprogramming.  Finally, this thesis presents the design of a foundational programming language, motivated by the analysis of template metaprogramming, that allows programs to statically inspect type information, perform computations, and generate code.

While previous work established the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions, defining representations that are faithful, efficient, and practical remains challenging.

We present its syntax and semantics, and build a compiler translating CRN++ programs into chemical reactions, thereby laying the foundation of a comprehensive framework for molecular programming. Our language addresses the key challenge of embedding familiar imperative constructs into a set of chemical reactions happening simultaneously and manipulating real-valued concentrations. Although some deviation from ideal output value cannot be avoided, we develop methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis tools.

      "Doc_Text:  Computational formalisms have been pushing the boundaries of the field of computing for the last 80 years and much debate has surrounded what computing entails; what it is, and what it is not. This paper seeks to explore the boundaries of the ideas of computation and provide a framework for enabling a constructive discussion of computational ideas. First, a review of computing is given, ranging from Turing Machines to interactive computing. Then, a variety of natural physical systems are considered for their computational qualities. From this exploration, a framework is presented under which all dynamical systems can be considered as instances of the class of abstract computational platforms. An abstract computational platform is defined by both its intrinsic dynamics and how it allows computation that is meaningful to an external agent through the configuration of constraints upon those dynamics. It is asserted that a platform’s computational expressiveness is directly related to the freedom with which constraints can be placed. Finally, the requirements for a formal constraint description language are considered and it is proposed that Abstract State Machines may provide a reasonable basis for such a language. Adiabatic quantum computation has recently attracted attention in the physics and computer science communities, but its computational power was unknown. We describe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm, which implies that the adiabatic computation model and the conventional quantum computation model are polynomially equivalent. Our result can be extended to the physically realistic setting of particles arranged on a two-dimensional grid with nearest neighbor interactions. The equivalence between the models provides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues in quantum computation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and constructing fault tolerant quantum computers. In particular, by translating the main open questions in the area of quantum algorithms to the language of spectral gaps of sparse matrices, the result makes these questions accessible to a wider scientific audience, acquainted with mathematical physics, expander theory and rapidly mixing Markov chains.\n",

Emerging programming models such as the task-based runtime StarPU and many-core architectures such as GPUs force programmers into choosing either low-level programming languages or putting complete faith in the compiler. As has been previously studied in extensive detail, both development approaches have their own respective trade-offs. The goal of this thesis is to help make parallel programming easier. It addresses these challenges by providing new compilation techniques for high-level programming languages that conform to commonly-accepted paradigms in order to leverage these emerging runtime systems and architectures. In particular, this dissertation makes several contributions to these challenges by leveraging the high-level programming language Chapel in order to efficiently map computation and data onto both the task-based runtime system StarPU and onto GPU-based accelerators. Different loop-based parallel programs and experiments are evaluated in order to measure the effectiveness of the proposed compiler algorithms and their optimizations, while also providing programmability metrics when leveraging high-level languages. In order to exploit additional performance when mapping onto shared memory systems, this thesis proposes a set of compiler and runtime-based heuristics that determine the profitable processor tile shapes and sizes when mapping multiply-nested parallel loops. Finally, a new benchmark-suite named P-Ray is presented. This is used to provide machine characteristics in a portable manner that can be used by either a compiler, an auto-tuning framework, or the programmer when optimizing their applications.\n",

Functional programmers use those abstractions directly while main-stream languages often integrate concrete instances as language features – e.g. generators in Python or asynchronous computations in C# 5.0. The question is, is there a sweet spot between convenient, hardwired language features, and an inconvenient but flexible libraries? F# computation expressions answer this question in the affirmative. Unlike the “do” notation in Haskell, computation expressions are not tied to a single kind of abstraction. They support a wide range of abstractions, depending on what operations are available. F# also provides greater syntactic flexibility leading to a more intuitive syntax, without resorting to full macro-based meta-programming. We present computation expressions in a principled way, developing a type system that captures the semantics of the calculus.

      "Doc_Text:  We construct a universal and even logically fully abstract realizability model for the sequential functional programming language of call-by-name FPC. This model is defined within the category of modest sets over the total combinatory algebra L of observational equivalence classes of closed terms of the untyped programming language lambda+Error. This language is untyped lazy call-by-name lambda-calculus extended by a single constant ERR and a conditional construct which distinguishes this constant from any other syntactic value. Universality and (constructive) logical full abstraction of the model are proved in three steps. Firstly, a canonical universal and logically fully abstract realizability model for FPC over the typed combinatory algebra T of observational equivalence classes of closed FPC-terms is constructed. Then the recursive type U := mu alpha. void + [ alpha --> alpha ] is shown to be universal, i.e. any other type is a definable retract of U.

      "Doc_Text:  Do boys and girls learn differently? The perception of Modern Foreign Language learning appears to show that there is an increasing gap between the attainment of boys and girls. In this research I have chosen to focus on the secondary school context and particularly on two main questions: Do boys and girls display different aptitudes when learning a Modern Foreign Language? Does a difference in teaching style affect learning in a secondary school context, either when comparing boys and girls, or when comparing the learning of German or French in similar contexts? The first phase of my research involved conducting aptitude tests, initially using the MLAT-E, as developed by Carroll and Sapon. This test, conducted in English, was originally intended to demonstrate whether learners have an aptitude for learning a Foreign Language, by focussing on phonetic coding, grammar handling, rote memorization, inductive language learning ability. A test written and performed in English may provide some insights into students' aptitude for learning a foreign language, but in order to investigate differences in learning either French or German, I developed further tests, using the same principles, but which were conducted in French and German. In both of these tests there appears to be no significant difference between the performance of boys and girls in the specific context, and no significant difference between the two languages. It is often assumed that boys learn by breaking tasks down into clear cut rules, and girls learn by following examples. Using a range of inductive and deductive teaching strategies, students were taught how to use the simple future tense in French and German. Students were observed during the teaching phase, both during whole class activities, and in group work situations, and were interviewed after completing their final assessments, to ascertain how they managed the tasks. When comparing students' understanding and application of the simple future tense, I could again, observe no significant difference between boys and girls, or between the learning of German and French. This research has been conducted among a range of mixed ability classes in KS3 (age 11-14) in a comprehensive school. This action research is significant for teachers of Modern Foreign Languages in the secondary school, as we move forwards from the new KS2 MFL curriculum component. The questions remain, however, as to why there is still such a disparity in the results of boys and girls at GCSE and how teachers can encourage boys in their pursuit of language learning.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Truth and falsehood, questions and answers, construction and deconstruction; most things come in dual pairs.  Duality is a mirror that reveals the new from the old via opposition.  This idea appears pervasively in logic, where duality inverts \"true\" with \"false\" and \"and\" with \"or.\"  However, even though programming languages are closely connected to logics, this kind of strong duality is not so apparent in practice.  Sum types (disjoint tagged unions) and product types (structures) are dual concepts, but in the realm of programming, natural biases obscure their duality. To better understand the role of duality in programming, we shift our perspective.  Our approach is based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism which says that programs following a specification are the same as proofs for mathematical theorems. This thesis explores Gentzen's sequent calculus, a logic steeped in duality, as a model for computational duality.  By applying the Curry-Howard isomorphism to the sequent calculus, we get a language that combines dual programming concepts as equal opposites: data types found in functional languages are dual to co-data types (interface-based objects) found in object-oriented languages, control flow is dual to information flow, induction is dual to co-induction.  This gives a duality-based semantics for reasoning about programs via orthogonality: checking safety and correctness based on a comprehensive test suite. We use the language of the sequent calculus to apply ideas from logic to issues relevant to program compilation.  The idea of logical polarity reveals a symmetric basis of primitive programming constructs that can faithfully represent all user-defined data and co-data types.  We reflect the lessons learned back into a core language for functional languages, at the cost of symmetry, with the relationship between the sequent calculus and natural deduction.  This relationship lets us derive a pure lambda calculus with user-defined data and co-data which we further extend by bringing out the implicit control-flow in functional programs.  Explicit control-flow lets us share and name control the same way we share and name data, enabling a direct representation of join points, which are essential for tractable optimization and compilation.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Stratification economics represents an important new approach devoted to explaining economic inequality in terms of how social groups are separated or stratified along economic lines. This paper combines stratification economics with identity economics to address complications that the phenomenon of intersectionality – people having multiple social group identities – creates for stratification economics. It distinguishes two types of social identities recognized by social psychologists, categorical and relational social identities, and uses this distinction to explain how individuals’ personal identities, understood as ordered sets of social identities, can be seen to be both socially and self-constructed. Individuals order and rank their categorical social identities according to weights they assign to them in interactive social settings in which their role-based relational social identities combine different categorical social identities. Recent research in social psychology in the stigma identity threat literature is then reviewed to distinguish two different ways in which individuals respond to others’ stigmatization of their social groups in interactive settings. The paper argues that individuals respond to stigma by assigning weights to their categorical social group identities in ways that reflect both functional power relationships and stigmatization in a way that on balance tend to reinforce social stratification.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  The history of dissent in economics has thus far been subject to scant interest. The existing scholarship, authored by dissenters probing their own past, has failed to address the crucial questions of how dissent emerged and rooted itself. This study is about two dissenting communities, Radical Political Economics and Post Keynesian Economics. I review the circumstances that led to their emergence in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I draw from the histories of religious and scientific dissent to explore the making of the dissenters' challenge to the economics orthodoxy. Notably, I use the concept of boundary work to analyse the debates between dissenters and mainstream. The history of Radical Political Economics begins with the founding in 1968 of the Union for Radical Political Economics. Onto this Union converged a generation of young radicalised academics that sought to unite their political interests and their scholarly pursuits. After a period devoted to the design of a \"paradigm of conflict,\" radicals turned to outreach work with popular movements. The new commitment brought divisive political identities into their Union that barred any agreement on a programme to transform economics. Post Keynesian Economics emerged in the aftermath of debates on capital theory between Cambridge left Keynesians and neoclassical economists. With the conviction that the debates signalled the emergence of a new theory in economics, American dissenters decided to ally with the Cambridge critics. The content of the alliance was redefined many times in the 1970s by a succession of spokespersons for the group. Of this period resulted a weakly bound community joined by a sense of shared ancestry. The two case studies reveal the diverse resources and allies that dissenters mustered for their battle with the economics orthodoxy. They show how the dissenters' challenge shaped the boundaries of their communities and the content of their identity.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  My thesis consists of three chapters on information economics and financial economics.Chapter 1:Many decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) markets have recently become subject to new regulations requiring transparency. I build up an information model that features bilateral trade in a double auction, endogenous public signal, and inter-dealer network formation to study the effect of TRACE on the inter-dealer markets. In the trading stage, I study the private information diffusion process and endogenize the public information contained in the disseminated trading price. I show that in markets with a relatively low degree of information asymmetry, post-trade transparency makes the adverse selection more severe and reduces the surplus from asset reallocation between dealers, and thus hurts the inter-dealer network formation. Investors are more likely to be symmetrically uninformed about thinly traded bonds. The empirical results provide evidence that TRACE has a significant negative effect on the inter-dealer trading frequency for thinly traded bonds.Chapter 2 (with Kim-Sau Chung):During currency crises, large traders once simultaneously short the asset markets and currency market. We study the large trader's information manipulation in crises by introducing a large trader in an asset market and a currency-attack coordination game with imperfect information. The asset price realized in the asset market aggregates dispersed private information acting as a public signal in the currency attack game. We show that the incentive of the large trader to manipulate the asset price in favor of its currency attack leads to financial contagion. In equilibrium, the large trader's manipulating the asset price to be lower and attacking the currency regime are concurrent; the large trader's manipulation in the asset market is most significant when the public signal is in the intermediate range. To draw policy implication regarding the market transparency, we show that when the asset market is transparent, a natural equilibrium refinement that incorporates forward induction reasoning would select the equilibrium where every trader behaves most aggressively in the currency-attack game and the currency regime is most fragile.Chapter 3 (with Yinqiu Lu):The way central banks manage their foreign reserve assets has evolved over the past decades. One major trend is managing reserves in two or more tranches -- liquidity tranche and investment tranche -- especially for those with adequate reserves. Incorporating reserve tranching, we have developed in this paper a central bank’s reserve portfolio choice model to analyze the determinants of the currency composition of reserves. In particular, we adopt the classical mean-variance framework for the investment tranche and the asset-liability framework for the liquidity tranche. Building on these frameworks, the roles of currency compositions in imports invoicing and short-term external debt, and risk and returns of reserve currencies can be quantified by our structural model -- a key contribution of our paper given the absence of structural models in the literature. Finally, we estimate the potential paths of the share of RMB in reserves under different scenarios to shed light on its status as an international currency.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  Behavioural economics draws upon fieldwork, experiments and research in disciplines such as psychology for building blocks to construct economic analysis that is more descriptively realistic and both augments and qualifies traditional economics as a tool for designing policy. Though behavioural economics has attracted much attention and respectability in the past decade or so, its roots date back to work undertaken in Europe a century ago and in the US in the middle of the twentieth century. Whereas economists traditionally have seen choice as an optimising activity subject to given preferences and a well-defined budget constraint, behavioural economics sees everyday life as a process in which humans with limited cognitive capacity try to cope with both information overload and the absence of relevant information and knowledge by evolving targets for what seems feasible and systems of rules for trying to find ways of meeting these targets. Some decision rules may be fast and frugal means of arriving at choices that do not result in needlessly poor attainments. However, much of what is known about how people actually behave implies that many people could be doing a lot better for themselves in many situations if only they were aware of the limitations of their ways of coping with the world and were motivated to find and apply improved decision rules. Poor search strategies limit the competitive pressures faced by firms and hence may have longer-term impacts on welfare via reduced productivity growth or innovation. However, in designing policies to promote better search by consumers one must remember that many consumers are also workers: higher productivity and better or cheaper goods may sometimes come at the cost of people having to work harder. To the extent that firms are aware of shortcomings of consumers' decision-making processes, they may be in a position to apply this knowledge to manipulate choices, for example by how they frame information that is presented to consumers. Tendencies for consumers to lack self-control and to fail to reflect on the longer-term implications of their choices can very easily result in poor choices when credit is easily available. Regulatory policies could do more to promote careful reflection by consumer by erecting hurdles to delay choice, as well as by measures to make it easier for consumers to make comparisons and see the financial implications of particular choices. In designing such policies there is scope for integrating them with policies aimed at the promotion of self-funded retirement and environmental wellbeing. The paper ends with detailed case study discussions of problems of choice in the markets for building renovation services and financial services. In the former, problems of finding good value for money are increased by the one-off nature of much of the work and by combination of shortages of trades-people relative to demand and large numbers of potential suppliers to approach for quotations. The environment is also conducive to consumers ending up overcapitalising in their renovations. In the market for financial services, the balance of risk-taking with property speculation and suchlike is stacked in favour of the loan providers, whilst the chances of inexperienced speculators getting into difficulties are enhanced because they are prone to use decision rules they have picked up from others belatedly and in simplified form. The implications of borrowing and superannuation choices should be made much more transparent to consumers, along with the futility of trying to beat the market rather than investing in market index funds.\n",

      "Doc_Text:  This paper assesses the current state of law and economics, standard and behavioral, and proposes an additional element to the basic belief-desire apparatus of economic theory in order to create a more unified theory of behavior. The first part of the paper assesses the current status of standard economic theory. While standard models have had their successes, a large and growing body of empirical evidence reveals that people often fail to live up its rational-actor ideal. In response, economists usually stick with standard consumer theory and attempt to explain the anomalous results by referring to some overlooked input (e.g., some new belief) or by applying the old models in new ways (e.g., multiple-selves accounts). But there are some cases that standard approaches just can\\u27t explain, and they don\\u27t seem to have the resources needed to expand their explanatory reach. Behavioral economics, the focus of the second part of the paper, is not without problems of its own. Chief among these is that it has not coalesced into a unified theory of behavior. This is problematic because there are inconsistent (and irreconcilable) behavioral explanations for particular bits of behavior; it is also difficult to figure out how behavioral and standard accounts fit together. The root of the problem, though, is not that behavioral models are under-theorized, but that they are under-motivated. Behavioral economists often fail to draw a distinction between empirical evidence and what it is evidence for. This sort of curve fitting approach explains why behavioral explanations are less than satisfying, and also helps explain why behavioral economics has not coalesced into a unified theory. The usual methods for accommodating the empirical evidence regarding economic theory share the following feature: they take the basic economic account as canonical. Accept, reject, or tinker with the functional forms, most economists, standard and behavioral, confine themselves to thinking about the particular elements of common sense (namely, desires and beliefs) that originally inspired economic models. There is, however, another approach. Economic theory (and its successors) might be too distilled - after all, there is much more to our common-sense theory of behavior than the claim that people act to get what they want. Recognizing this possibility allows us to see that we can look for additional resources in common sense to enhance economic models in a top down instead of bottom up way. The third and final part of the paper discusses one such approach based on Frederic Schick\\u27s work on understandings. Drawn from the well of common-sense psychology, the concept of understandings presents an additional element to the basic belief-desire apparatus that underlies economic theory. The idea, in a nutshell, is that people normally consider their circumstances from a particular perspective and, as a result, they act on proper subsets of their beliefs and desires that reflect their take on their situations. This approach can be readily integrated into standard economic theory and is capable of shedding crucial light on many of the situations that give standard accounts trouble (and give rise to behavioral alternatives). As such, it is a step in the direction of a more unified theory of human behavior.\n",

This division in economics reects the division in ecology between population and systems ecologists. Recent developments in ecology are aimed at a more integrated approach to ecologic al research. One example of such an approach is that of models based on thermodynamic reaction networks. By applying the \\Law of Mass Action\" to biochemical descriptions of ecological networks, it is possible to reformulate ecological systems models as population dynamic models, which can then be embedded within a bioeconomic model framework.

      "Doc_Text:  In this dissertation three different economic issues have been analyzed. The first issue is whether monetary policy rules can improve forecasting accuracy of inflation. The second is whether the preference of a central bank is symmetry or not. The last issue is whether the behavior of aggregate dividends is asymmetry. Each issue is considered in Chapter II, III and IV, respectively. The linkage between monetary policy rules and the prediction of inflation is explored in Chapter II. Our analysis finds that the prediction performance of the term structure model hinges on monetary policy rules, which involve the manipulation of the federal funds rate in response to the change in the price level. As the Fed's reaction to inflation becomes stronger, the predictive information contained in the term structure becomes weaker. Using the long-run Taylor rule, a new assessment of the prediction performance regarding future change in inflation is provided. The empirical results indicate that the long-run Taylor rule improves forecasting accuracy. In chapter III, the asymmetric preferences of the central bank of Korea are examined under New Keynesian sticky prices forward-looking economy framework. To this end,  this chapter adopts the central bank's objective functional form as a linear-exponential function instead of the standard quadratic function. The monetary policy reaction function is derived and then asymmetric preference parameters are estimated during the inflation targeting period: 1998:9-2005:12. The empirical evidence supports that while the objective of output stability is symmetry, but the objective of price stability is not symmetry. Specifically, it appears that the central bank of Korea aggressively responds to positive inflation gaps compared to negative inflation gaps. Chapter IV examines the nonlinear dividend behavior of the aggregate stock market. We propose a nonlinear dividend model that assumes managers minimize the regime dependent adjustment costs associated with being away from their target dividend payout. By using the threshold vector error correction model, we find significant evidence of a threshold effect in aggregate dividends of S&P 500 Index in quarterly data when real stock prices are used for the target. We also find that when dividends are relatively higher than target, the adjustment cost of dividends is much smaller than that when they are lower.\n",

This paper reviews the basic themes of behavioral economics: Sensitivity of revealed preferences to descriptions of goods and procedures; generalizations of models of choice over risk, ambiguity, and time; fairness and reciprocity; non-Bayesian judgment; and stochastic equilibrium and learning. A central issue is what happens in equilibrium when agents are imperfect but heterogeneous; sometimes firms “repair” limits through sorting, but profit-maximizing firms can also exploit limits of consumers.

      "Doc_Text:  The three chapters of this dissertation investigate major puzzles in international economics and labor economics. The first chapter investigates the macroeconomic effects of primary commodities trade flows across countries with different export composition. The second chapter studies labor flows of workers with similar skill-level and across countries with similar income. Lastly, the third chapter evaluates the macroeconomic effects of a health policy in the United States. Chapter 1 analyzes how the production and price volatility of primary commodities account for the co-movement between real GDP and terms of trade. Primary commodity exporter countries face large terms of trade fluctuations, largely driven by primary commodity price shocks and amplified by the relative importance of primary commodities in the countries’ exports. In this chapter, I document that an increase in the price of a primary commodity is usually followed by a decrease in terms of trade, defined as the relative price of imports over exports, and an increase in real GDP in these countries. Meanwhile, countries that do not export primary commodities enjoy more stable terms of trade, and their real GDP is positively correlated with terms of trade. Although the literature on primary commodity exporters has focused on developing countries, I show that this relation is independent of a country’s income level. Since standard models are unable to generate real aggregate fluctuations from price shocks if real GDP is correctly measured, this paper identifies a puzzle. I propose a class of mechanisms that is capable of explaining the heterogeneous impact of terms of trade fluctuations across countries. I show that a possible resolution is to incorporate the presence of idle resources and a production cost externality in the primary commodity producing sector in order to connect terms of trade fluctuations to real GDP fluctuations. When subjected to a primary commodity price shock, the model successfully accounts for the behavior of terms of trade and its relation to real GDP for different export compositions. Chapter 2, joint work with Maria Jose Rodriguez Garcia and Rocio Madera, revisits empirical evidence on migration within the European Union-15, disaggregated by occupation. We find that workers move to countries where their type is relatively more abundant among natives. This is at odds with traditional models of migration. We develop a model with external economies of scale that generates an agglomeration force in high-educated labor. Our main result is that a country that is relatively abundant in highly educated labor force will attract foreign labor of the same type. We argue this type of model is more suitable to analyze migration flows between countries of similar income level. Finally, Chapter 3, joint with Juan Carlos Conesa, Parisa Kamali, Timothy Kehoe, Vegard Nygard, Gajendran Raveendranathan, and Akshar Saxena, develops an overlapping generations model to study the macroeconomic effects of an unexpected elimination of Medicare. We find that a large share of the elderly respond by substituting Medicaid for Medicare. Consequently, the government saves only 46 cents for every dollar cut in Medicare spending. We argue that a comparison of steady states is insufficient to evaluate the welfare effects of the reform. In particular, we find lower ex-ante welfare gains from eliminating Medicare when we account for the costs of transition. Lastly, we find that a majority of the current population benefits from the reform but that aggregate welfare, measured as the dollar value of the sum of wealth equivalent variations, is higher with Medicare\n",

      "Doc_Text:  This paper presents an algebraic theory of linear signal processing. At the core of algebraic signal processing is the concept of a linear signal model defined as a triple (A, M, phi), where familiar concepts like the filter space and the signal space are cast as an algebra A and a module M, respectively, and phi generalizes the concept of the z-transform to bijective linear mappings from a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into the module M. A signal model provides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application, such as infinite and finite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete space, or the various forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As soon as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, including the associated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift operator is a key concept in the algebraic theory: it is the generator of the algebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology leads to the associated signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite and finite time models with associated infinite and finite z-transforms, and to infinite and finite space models with associated infinite and finite C-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete cosine and sine transforms are Fourier transforms for the finite space models. Other definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new transforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions, separable and non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance (the algebra of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and signal extensions, the connections between linear transforms and linear finite Gauss-Markov fields, and several other concepts and connections.Comment: 67 pages.

      "Doc_Text:  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive technology for imaging human brain function. Contemporary methods of analysing MEG data include dipole fitting, minimum norm estimation (MNE) and beamforming. These are concerned with localising brain activity, but in isolation they do not provide concrete evidence of interaction among brain regions. Since cognitive neuroscience demands answers to this type of question, a novel signal processing framework has been developed consisting of three stages. The first stage uses conventional MNE to separate a small number of underlying source signals from a large data set. The second stage is a novel time-frequency analysis consisting of a recursive filter bank. Finally, the filtered outputs from different brain regions are compared using a unique partial cross-correlation analysis that accounts for propagation time. The output from this final stage could be used to construct conditional independence graphs depicting the internal networks of the brain. In the second processing stage, a complementary pair of high- and low-pass filters is iteratively applied to a discrete time series. The low-pass output is critically sampled at each stage, which both removes redundant information and effectively scales the filter coefficients in time. The approach is similar to the Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT), but features a more sophisticated resampling step. This, in combination with the filter design procedure leads to a finer frequency resolution than the FWT.

      "Doc_Text:  Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive technology for imaging human brain function. Contemporary methods of analysing MEG data include dipole fitting, minimum norm estimation (MNE) and beamforming. These are concerned with localising brain activity, but in isolation they do not provide concrete evidence of interaction among brain regions. Since cognitive neuroscience demands answers to this type of question, a novel signal processing framework has been developed consisting of three stages. The first stage uses conventional MNE to separate a small number of underlying source signals from a large data set. The second stage is a novel time-frequency analysis consisting of a recursive filter bank. Finally, the filtered outputs from different brain regions are compared using a unique partial cross-correlation analysis that accounts for propagation time. The output from this final stage could be used to construct conditional independence graphs depicting the internal networks of the brain. In the second processing stage, a complementary pair of high- and low-pass filters is iteratively applied to a discrete time series. The low-pass output is critically sampled at each stage, which both removes redundant information and effectively scales the filter coefficients in time. The approach is similar to the Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT), but features a more sophisticated resampling step. This, in combination with the filter design procedure leads to a finer frequency resolution than the FWT. The subsequent correlation analysis is unusual in that a latency estimation procedure is included to establish the probable transmission delays between regions of interest. This test statistic does not follow the same distribution as a conventional correlation measures, so an empirical model has been developed to facilitate hypothesis testing. \n",

      "Doc_Text:  This paper presents a reliable method for target vessel identification in passive sonar by exploiting the underlying periodicity of propeller noise signal, using the principles of cyclostationarity. In conventional signal processing methods, random signals are treated as statistically stationary and the parameters of the underlying physical mechanism that generates the signal would not vary in time. However, for most manmade signals, some parameters vary periodically with time and this requires that random signals be modeled as cyclostationary. In the field of sonar, the propeller noise signal generated by underwater vessels is cyclostationary. As a ship propagates in the sea, noise generated during the collapse of cavitation-induced bubbles are modulated by the rotating propeller shaft and this results in characteristic amplitude modulated random noise signal, which can be detected using passive sonar. Processing these signals, the number of blades and the shaft frequency of the propeller can be identified. In this work, cyclostationary processing technique is introduced for processing propeller noise signal and it is observed to provide better noise immunity.

Practically the problem can be reduced to obtaining the transmission function of the medium.

      "Doc_Text:  An adaptive filter is a digital filter that can adjust its coefficients to give the best match. An adaptive filter is a digital filter that can adjust its coefficients to give the best match to a given desired signal. When an adaptive filter operates in a changeable environment the filter coefficients can adapt in response to changes in the applied input signals. Adaptive filters depend on recursive algorithms to update their coefficients and train them to near the optimum solution. An everyday example of adaptive filters is in the telephone system where, impedance mismatches causing echoes of a signal are a significant source of annoyance to the users of the system. The adaptive signal process is here to estimate and generate the echo path and compensate for it. To do this the echo path is viewed as an unknown system with some impulse response and the adaptive filter must mimic this response. Adaptive Filters are generally implemented in the time domain which works well in most scenarios however in many applications the impulse response become long, and increasing the complexity of the filter beyond a level where it can no longer be implemented efficiently in the time domain. An example of acoustic echo cancellation applications is in hands free telephony system. However there exists an alternative solution and that is to implement the filters in the frequency domain. The Discrete Fourier Transform or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) allows the conversion of signals from the time domain to the frequency domain in an efficient manner. Despite the efficiency of the FFT the overhead involved in converting the signals to the frequency domain does place a restriction on the use of the algorithm. When the impulse response of the unknown system and hence the impulse response of the filter is long enough however this is not an issue since the computational cost of the conversion is much less than that of the time domain algorithm. The actual filtering of the signals requires little computational cost in the frequency domain. Investigation of the so-called crossover point, the point where the frequency domain implementation becomes more efficient than the time domain implementation is important to establish the point where frequency domain implementation becomes practical\n",

      "['The long, arduous journey that was the fantasy football season came to an end as we waved goodbye to the 2012 calendar year.', 'We watched a very strange, topsy-turvy campaign that included myriad injuries, confusing performance trends and the disappearances of many former stars.', \"United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann provided six reasons for American fans to follow the Mexican First Division — now called Liga MX — when he named his squad for last week's stunning 1-0 victory over Mexico at Estadio Azteca.\", 'There is always risk involved when you’re a team maybe good enough to win the NBA title and you make a deal at the trade deadline in February, just a few short months before the playoffs begin.', 'The Rasheed Wallace trade the Pistons made in 2004 probably wasn’t a very risky move – but it took an incredible amount of work and persuading on Joe Dumars’ behalf to get it done.', 'But the 1989 trade that sent Adrian Dantley to Dallas for Mark Aguirre – that was a risky move.', 'Hector \"Macho\" Camacho\\'s life was full of tumult, yet the toll of time and the demons from his personal life didn’t keep him away from the ring.', 'When you look at how this season has gone for the Pistons, you can’t help but look at the timing of moving Jason Maxiell into the starting lineup at power forward and how that move really made everything fall into place for Lawrence Frank’s frontcourt rotation.', 'The power forward position with the Pistons has become one of absolute strength.', 'It took a lot of experimentation before Lawrence decided to start Jason, bring Jonas Jerebko off the bench but give him significant minutes, and let Ben Wallace play significant minutes as the backup to Greg Monroe at center.', 'The results show they were dead-on in terms of what was the right thing to do for this team.', 'The Pistons are 17-14 since Jason began starting at power forward.', 'They’re obviously surging despite facing a tough road trip, but they left on this trip winners of five of six and nine of the last 11 at home.', 'This particular rotation has worked out perfectly.', '\\ufeffI HAD a really upsetting phone call the other day.', 'The January transfer window generally passes by with negligible notice by Sir Alex Ferguson.', 'In fact, the last major business I remember being done in January (could be wrong here) was the signing of Evra and Vidic in 2006.', 'Both of them became first team regulars, but it took them a while to settle in.', 'That has always been Sir Alex’s main aversion to signing mid-season; even if you get a good player, they don’t have any integration period so it can put the team out of joint.', 'Fair enough.', 'But the transfer that has been announced today will not fall into that category.', 'Wilfred Zaha will join United, but not until July 2013.', 'Cape Town - Each round of the 2012/13 English Premiership season, a panel of Sport24 staff and occasional guest tipsters have a crack at predicting the results – do it yourself, if you like, and see how you compare afterwards.', 'For those of you who don\\'t know, I announced my \"divorce\" from the game of basketball this past summer and on Sept. 22, 2012, I played my last game.', 'Chuck Daly would say of the great Bad Boys teams that maybe some opponents could stick with his starters, but nobody could play with his bench.', 'This bench Lawrence Frank has put together recently is about as exciting a group as the Pistons have had since that time.', 'Vinnie Johnson led the bench brigade for the Bad Boys and usually had one of the starting guards, Isiah or Joe D, out there with him, and while those two are both Hall of Famers, Vinnie was the catalyst of that group.', '\\ufeffCan you believe there were actually people who thought I was dumb enough to fight you?', 'My nickname is Big Diesel, not Big Dummy.', '\\ufeffI love the actual football games, of course, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to loving the anticipation, the buildup and ultimate culmination of the NFL Draft just as much.', '\"I don\\'t just want winners.', 'I want champions,\" Jerry Buss said.', 'Now that we’re done with the NBA All-Star Game and Kobe Bryant exerting his every fiber to prove some meaningless point in a meaningless game against LeBron James, we can get back to the regular season’s home stretch and the one glaring fact that will shape every bit of it.', '\\ufeffIt looks a mis-match on paper: the runaway Bundesliga leaders, winners of the European Cup four times, against an Arsenal side that lost 1-0 to Championship Blackburn in the FA Cup at the weekend.', 'Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com.', 'He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer.', 'He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan.', 'Follow him on Twitter.', 'For the first time since 2002, Douglas is not spending the  winter months traveling between her home in Greece (with husband Vasilis) and  basketball stops throughout Europe.', 'While playing professionally in Russia,  Spain, Turkey and Lithuania, Douglas has been a EuroLeague All-Star and a  regular veteran in EuroLeague competition, once leading all of Europe in  scoring and frequently competing with the top clubs on the continent.', 'Absorbing  the cultures, the languages and the cuisine has become one of the favorite  staples of her worldly lifestyle.', 'As a point guard, Lawson led the University of Tennessee to three Final Four appearances, Team USA to a gold medal at the Beijing Olympic Games and the Sacramento Monarchs to a WNBA Championship.', 'Off the court, Lawson is a top women\\x92s and men\\x92s college basketball analyst at ESPN and tireless contributor to important community and charitable organizations.', 'February didn’t get off to the start the Pistons wanted with the loss to Charlotte, but the stretch of games ahead still represents a golden opportunity for this team.', 'We know there are great veterans on the Pistons, but we also know there are some young people who can learn from playing under some pressure.', 'And that’s what this is – it’s pressure to get back into the playoff hunt.', 'The loss to Charlotte probably was like a shot in the mouth to this team.', 'The Bobcats are the No.', '8 team in the East right now, so not only do the Pistons have to jump a couple of other teams, they have to pass Charlotte to make it into the playoffs.', 'Maybe it was kind of a wakeup call.', 'Obviously, the Bobcats were focused and the young Pistons and their veterans have to know what they’re up against here.', \"Somewhere in the muddle and mistakes and missed chances marking Royce White's growing schism between himself and the team that believed in him despite glaring red flags is a more common challenge facing NBA organizations.\", 'I had never been into gymnastics — never been drawn into its drama, captivated by its beauty and nerves or affected by the performances that crush some dreams while completing others.', 'His induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame was one of three wonderful things that happened for Mr. Davidson in his last year.', 'I know I’m not the only one looking forward to the visits over the next two weekends – John Salley on Saturday night for the Indiana game and Dennis Rodman next Friday for the Chicago Bulls – at The Palace from two of the central figures on the great Bad Boys champions.', 'I know Pistons fans old enough to remember those title teams are going to have a lot of memories stirred and emotions brought to the surface by their returns.', 'When I think back to the time they were drafted, I was so convinced Jack McCloskey was going to get it right as I looked at the upsides of both of those guys.', 'He felt like if there was one thing the Pistons needed, it was some guys who could get after people defensively, play above the rim and fly up and down the court.', 'Hi, folks!', 'Now that I’ve recovered from my end-of-season hangover, it’s time to hand out some fantasy football awards for 2012.', 'The votes from our esteemed panel have been meticulously counted, and … ah, that’s a lie.', 'I’m the only voter.', 'Let’s get going.', '\\x93I could see where I was sitting each time she (Laurel J. Richie) opened the envelope, and the first one I saw was Washington.', 'My first instinct was that I felt sorry because they really needed that pick.', 'Then that went away and I saw the next one, and I saw the order they were going in, and then all of a sudden I realized it \\x96 we just got the No.', '1 pick.', 'It\\x92s just got to be lucky.\\x94', '\\ufeffTechnically, the San Francisco 49ers are the home team in Super Bowl XLVII, and as grand arrivals go, their landing in New Orleans on an unseasonably warm Sunday evening was rather calm and unassuming.', 'Players casually walked off the team plane dressed in casual attire, minus handheld video recorders recording the moment.', 'Nobody waved to the crowd.', 'They offered no real hint of the hoopla to come.', '\\ufeffJovan Belcher, a starting linebacker for the Chiefs, murdered the mother of his child shortly before 8 a.m. Saturday.', 'He hopped in his car, drove to the Kansas City Chiefs practice facility, thanked Romeo Crennel and Scott Pioli — and shot himself in the head in front of his coach and general manager around 8:10 a.m.', 'Survive and advance is a popular sports mantra normally saved for the month of March and the madness that comes with it.', \"Hey, it's not every day the Wildcats knock off a top five team — though they sure are trying.\", \"Each FOXSports.com fantasy contributor shared three-to-five fantasy baseball sleepers to keep an eye on heading into owners' fantasy baseball drafts.\", 'Over the next two months, expect several updates to our positional fantasy baseball catcher rankings.',
